The new multi-purpose room addition adjacent to the historic Strawberry Hill Workers Quarters was proposed to be a fully naturally ventilated building filled with natural light and with large glazed areas connecting the indoor and outdoor environment.

SBE was engaged to conduct a thermal and comfort analysis with the scope to optimise the design, its shading strategies and report on the likely indoor temperatures that could be experienced over a typical year.

As part of this analysis, SBE proposed strategies to optimise the building envelope, reduced solar heat gains and maximise passive cooling.
