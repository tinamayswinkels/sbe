In partnership with key stakeholders, the City of Melton delivered a pavilion to compliment and provide supporting infrastructure and amenities for the Athletics Track & Field, and Hockey facilities.

The project delivered a pavilion to provide for changing room facilities for Athletics and Hockey, umpires rooms, first aid, DDA facilities, social space with views to sports surfaces, kitchen facilities, public toilets, storage, and multipurpose internal space, and a separate secure storage facility to house athletics and hockey equipment, and associated operational plant.

As the ESD consultant, SBE worked with the project team to integrate a number of ESD initiatives, including:

* Light coloured roofing material to assist in comfort control in summer.
* High spec glazing and increased insulation levels (by placing the main layer of insulation well above ceiling level the architects aim to maintain an unbroken insulation barrier).
* Good controls on all active systems.
* Indoor LED lighting controlled by presence sensors and timeclock.
* External lighting controlled by timeclock and PE cells.

The large roof area of this project provides excellent opportunities for the collection and reuse of rainwater, which can reduce potable water use. However, the site is already served by class A recycled water which will be available for all flushing and non potable demands. Rainwater will instead be intercepted beyond the site boundary in a site wide designed drainage and treatment system that incorporates wetlands.
