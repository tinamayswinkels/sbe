The development comprises 3 levels of office space built atop the existing Pool at Greensborough (WaterMarc).

The building has a very deep floor plate, with some terraces to the upper floors. The terrace areas will have planting

boxes and a green wall suspended from a light weight structure and wrapping partially over the north facade of the building.
