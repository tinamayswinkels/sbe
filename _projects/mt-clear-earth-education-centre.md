The Mt Clear Earth and Science Centre is a school building for the Mt Clear Secondary School housing classrooms, laboratories and specialist support spaces. The floor area is approximately 900m&sup2;. The client was keen for the building to represent the schoolâ€™s commitment to the environment and to become a 3D textbook in its own right.

The brief called for a comfortable zero energy, zero water and zero waste facility and the integration of &nbsp;many ESD initiatives, ranging from water saving and waste minimisation through to biofuel generation, a photovoltaic array and a virtual battery bank.
