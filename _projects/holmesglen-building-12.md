The 5 Star Green Star – Education Design v1 Holmesglen TAFE Building 12 in Glen Waverley.

A purpose-built three storey education facility, the building was a successful applicant project for a Commonwealth Education Investment Fund (EIF) grant for the construction of new learning spaces at the Waverley site.

The new $16.8M building provides facilities for Early Childhood Education, Vocational College and language programs together with general classrooms, PC labs, a lecture theatre and office space.

Environmental initiatives featured in the design include energy efficient lighting and control zones, a passive chilled beam air-conditioning system, well-insulated building fabric in external walls and the roof, high performance double glazing to limit unnecessary heat loss or gain to internal spaces and a 98kL water harvesting tank for irrigation, toilets and wash-down uses.

The predicted greenhouse gas emissions for this project are 172,237 kgCO2 /annum, a reduction of 52.6% compared to the benchmark established for the building by Green Star.

The Estimated Total Potable Water Consumption of 0.31 L/day/m² is a third of the benchmark established for the building by Green Star.
