The Kangan Instituteâ€™s Automotive Centre of Excellence is the largest automotive training facility in the southern hemisphere and the first educational institution granted a 5 Star Green Star rating from the Green Building Council of Australia.

As the Accredited Green Star Professional on the project, SBE collaborated with the integrated design team to develop the range of sustainability solutions that characterised this facility. BATISO active mass cooling and night sky cooling, together with chilled beams, thermal chimneys and natural ventilation are some of the initiatives that have been implemented and have contributed to a 68% reduction in HVAC energy demand.

Waterless urinals, a 130,000 litre rainwater tank, use of low VOC materials, and recycling of construction and demolition waste are some of the other initiatives that contributed to its Green Star rating.
