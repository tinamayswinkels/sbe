The Kangan Instituteâ€™s Automotive Centre of Excellence is the largest automotive training facility in the southern hemisphere and one of the first educational institutions granted a 5 Star Green Star rating from the Green Building Council of Australia.

SBE was the ESD Consultant and Accredited Green Star Professional on the project, collaborating closely with Gray Puksand Architects from the project pitch right through to the completion of construction.

The design features many innovative ESD&nbsp; initiatives designed to increase the comfort and efficiency of the building.&nbsp; They include:

* BATISO style activated thermal mass floor slabs&nbsp; decided to help maintain thermal neutrality within occupied spaces
* Night sky cooling of a large volume of captured rainwater.&nbsp; This 'coolth' is sued o
* &nbsp;
* slabse mass cooling and night sky cooling, together with chilled beams, thermal chimneys and natural ventilation are some of the initiatives that have been implemented and have contributed to a 68% reduction in HVAC energy demand.

Waterless urinals, a 130,000 litre rainwater tank, use of low VOC materials, and recycling of construction and demolition waste are some of the other initiatives that contributed to its Green Star rating.
