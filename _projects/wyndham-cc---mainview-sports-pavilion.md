The facility consists of a conditioned Social Area, small kitchen/kiosk, change rooms, back of house spaces, and outdoor bicycle parking.

As part of the project brief Wyndham City Council requested that the proposed design:

* Achieved a minimum ESD score of 50% using the ***[Built Environment Scorecard (BESS)](http://www.bess.net.au/)***.
* Maximised hard surfaces connected to rainwater harvesting or WSUD treatments.
* Incorporated facilities that facilitate waste recycling.
* Be constructed with materials, finishes and fittings that meet Council ESD and sustainable procurement standards.
* Resulted in a connected, universal access facility that encourages and provides for all travel options including pedestrians, cyclists, public transport and motorised mobility devices.
* Be landscaped to provide urban heat refuge and enhanced ecological value to the site.&nbsp;

As the project ESD consultant, SBE assisted the Architect and Project Team incorporating the necessary ESD initiatives into a practical and cost-effective design
