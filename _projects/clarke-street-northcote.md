The project is a fully constructed 3 storey development containing 12 townhouses with ground floor parking within.&nbsp; Located within walking distance of a train station and immediately adjacent a bus stop this low environmental impact design is an admirable example of responsible and sustainable urban consolidation.

Appointed by Kalex Developments and working with Breathe Architects, SBE provided initial ESD opportunity studies, including investigation of application of phase change material, the optimisation of clerestory design and the cost benefits of improved building fabric, more efficient appliances solar hot water systems, VSD drives on extraction fans and PV arrays.

SBE also provided preliminary energy ratings and the ESD Assessment that lead to a successful town planning outcome.

&nbsp;The design was predicted to achieve the following:

* Greenhouse emissions from Energy Use – 29% reduction. 7095kgCO2/year/dwelling
* Peak Energy Demand – 67.9% reduction. 1.0 kW peak/dwelling
* Mains Water Use – 29% reduction. 172.8 kL/year/dwelling
* Storm water Quality – 134%. 60.3% of nitrogen load removed

In additon to the above the apartments make use of recycled timber and other natural materials, have good daylighting and with north facing clerestories each dwelling receives direct winter sun at noon into its open stair well and down to the heart of the living area.
