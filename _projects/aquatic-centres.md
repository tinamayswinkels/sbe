SBE has worked with PTA on a number of Aquatic Centres, providing advice on building fabric, daylighting, Building Code compliance, materials and water saving initiatives.&nbsp; Recent projects have included WaterMarc, Sunshine Aquatic and the Doone Kennedy Aquatic Centre.

The Craigieburn Regional Aquatic & Leisure Centre (SPLASH) is to be completed in late 2017.

The modelled GHG emissions of the designed CRALC facility are **55% lower** than the GHG emissions of an equivalent reference building complying with the minimum Deemed-to-Satisfy provisions of NCC 2014 Section J.&nbsp; This is a significant improvement upon the 25% reduction target outlined by Hume City Council Greenhouse Action Plan

It is estimated that CRLAC will use **22.9L/visitor/day of potable water** which falls under the **Good** rating category (&lt;10-25L/patron) as per the Sydney Water guidelines for aquatic centres.&nbsp; This is equivalent to potable water use of **6.6kL/m<sup>2</sup> pool area/year**.&nbsp; The potable water use of existing operating aquatic centres in Victoria ranges between 3-29kL/m<sup>2</sup> pool area/year, with an average of 12kL//m<sup>2</sup> pool area/year.&nbsp; With a potable water use of 6.6kL/m<sup>2</sup> pool area/year, CRALC has the potential to place amongst the lowest users of potable water compared to other operating aquatic centres in Victoria
