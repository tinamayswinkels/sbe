SBE was engaged to provide a town planning ESD report for this proposed early learning centre. As part of the report, SBE conducted daylight and thermal modelling as well as a stormwater assessment.

The facility is proposed to include 13 classrooms anticipating a total number of 36 staff and 167 children. The development also includes a conference room, end-of-trip facilities and significant outdoor play area.
