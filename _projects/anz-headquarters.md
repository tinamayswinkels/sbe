SBE conducted a glare assessment to identify where direct and indirect solar exposure would result in glare, and consequential discomfort, for buildingâ€™s occupants. As part of this study, SBE also assessed a variety of methods available for eliminating glare while maintaining appropriate daylight levels and minimising artificial lighting energy demand.
