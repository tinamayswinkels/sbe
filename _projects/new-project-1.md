    We have nominated 8 criteria against

    and benchmarked.  We will use these 
    criteria to evolve and report upon

SBE has developed a Sustainaility Action Plan for PTA-HSPC in support of the ESG aspirations of their businesses and in alignment with their comittment to Architect's Declare.

The Sustainability Action Plan outlines a comprehensive framework for enhancing indoor environmental quality, health, and well-being.  They have nominated 8 criteria against which their architecture will be tested and benchmarked.  They will use these criteria to evolve and report upon design outcomes.  They will publish these outcomes.

The two distinguishing features of these criteria are that they are related to the passive performance the buildings (something within the architectâ€™s direct control) and they are measurable. Thus, the evaluations of their (ESD) Accountabilities will be objective.
