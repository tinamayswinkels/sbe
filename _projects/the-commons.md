Directly adjacent to a train station and close to trams and numerous amenities this site offers the residents the opportunity to live with a reduced carbon footprint. &nbsp;A resident choosing to live in the building may not need to use a car in their day to day life, will not need air conditioning to be comfortable, will not need to purchase and run their own inefficient domestic laundry appliances, will be able to grow some of their own food requirements and will be able to dispose of a large portion of their compostable waste.

The building has made the most of the site and its limited northern exposure. Deep balconies on the north and limited glazing to the east and west will help deal with unwanted sun and glare. Voids have been introduced to promote better daylight penetration and ventilation.
