The proposed Japara Healthcare development in Newport intends to provide a modern aged care facility consisting of 120 bedrooms, office/admin areas, laundry and commercial kitchen, a wellness centre, a cinema/chapel, a hair salon, and a number of communal areas including lounges, dining, and indoor and outdoor sitting areas.

SBE was engaged by JBA Consulting Engineers to conduct the sustainability assessment as part of the town planning requirements. The assessment was conducted using the Built Environment Sustainability Scorecard and included daylight modelling and preliminary thermal modelling.
