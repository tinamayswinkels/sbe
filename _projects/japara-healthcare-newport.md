The proposed Japara Healthcare development in Newport intends to provide a modern aged care facility consisting of 120 bedrooms, office/admin areas, laundry and commercial kitchen, a wellness centre, a cinema/chapel, a hair salon, and a number of communal areas including lounges, dining, and indoor and outdoor sitting areas.
