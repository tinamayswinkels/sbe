This state-of-the-art teaching facility is located on the University of South Australia Mawson Lakes Campus. SBE was involved in the project since early stages and used the Green Star Education Pilot tool to guide the buildingâ€™s design process which integrated passive measures such as optimised orientation, shading and insulation, as well as efficient active systems including chilled beams to achieve high levels of thermal comfort and energy efficiency.
