SBE provided NCC Section J compliance services for the new St. Vincent Hospital and Aged Care facilities in Werribee.

JV3 alternative compliance modelling was used to validate the Architect's vision for the building in relation to glazing and sky lighting.

The result is a series of comfortable and well daylit spaces that will contribute to the health and wellbeing of the occupants.
