This large warehouse style supermarket was constructed in the Docklands area in 2009.&nbsp; SBE provided assistance with town planning, Docklands Authority ESD reporting, daylight modelling and Section J compliance (using the JV3 methodology).

The following is a highlight of the environmentally sustainable design features:

* Re-development of a used site with access to public transportation (ferry, bus and train).
* Stormwater re-use for toilets and irrigation coupled with treatment in bio-retention beds.
* Landscape of native plantings.
* Bicycle parking and facilities provided for over employees and visitors.
* Reduction in potable water consumption through the use of rainwater collection and improved water fittings.
* Low lighting density supplemented by daylight through a roof of skylights.
* Refrigeration heat recovery for the hot water system.
* Improved indoor environment quality with low VOC materials, plantation timber and PVC reduction.
* Centralised waste storage and collection areas.
