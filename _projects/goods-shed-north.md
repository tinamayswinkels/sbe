The historic Goods Shed North at Melbourne Docklands, which has been derelict for thirty years, was renovated to a performing building achieving 5 Star Green Star base building and 5 Star Green Star interior ratings.

SBE was appointed as the Green Star Accredited Professional for the interior fitout which strongly focused on reducing potable water consumption through the use of water efficient appliances, fixtures and fittings.
