The Japara Aged Care facility in Rye is a two storey building consisting of approximately 99 nursing home bedrooms and supporting facilities such as laundry, commercial kitchen, chapel, beauty and hairdressing salon, various dining and lounge rooms, administration offices, reception, store rooms, and treatment rooms. The facility aims to achieve a 5 star Green Star Design & As Built certification.

SBE was engaged by JBA Consulting Engineers to conduct the Section J Part J1-J3 Energy Efficiency assessment following the Alternative Verification method JV3. The modelling results demonstrate a 10% improvement of the building fabric when compared to an equivalent reference building. This was achieved with the retention of single glazed louvre windows, the specification of high performing glazing (total U-value of 2.8 and SHGC of 0.27), and typical insulation levels.
