Estidama\* was developed to assess the sustainable performance of new construction projects in the context of the Middle East’s climate and culture. The program is not itself a green building rating system like LEED or BREEAM, but rather a collection of ideals that are imposed in an elective building code type of format. It provides both encouragement and a process for developers to gain recognition for the sustainable initiatives integrated into their projects. The program is voluntary.

Estidama guidelines include consideration for:

* Natural Systems
* Liveable City
* Resourceful Energy
* Precious Water
* Healthy Materials

SBE assessed the project against the Estidama categories and referenced other sustainable methodologies that could be used to complement and inform the sustainable outcomes of the project.
