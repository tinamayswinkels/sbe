### Project Goals

large grid connected photovoltaic array

The west facade will have a second

skin of Wonderglas (Ampelite

polycarbonate) battened off the exterior

wall that is open at the top and bottom.

This second skin will breathe and

reduce undesirable afternoon solar

gains on the main fa&ccedil;ade from the west.
