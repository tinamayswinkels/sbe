SBE was engaged to conduct a NCC Section J Part J1-J3 assessment on the new Western Sydney Wanderers FC gymnasium.

The Verification Method JV3 assesses the annual energy consumption of the proposed building and compares it to the annual energy consumption of a reference building (i.e. a building modelled using the minimum DTS Provisions of Section J of the NCC). This approach allows certain ‘trade-offs’, such as reducing the performance requirements of windows below the minimum required using the DTS Provisions, by for example, increasing the requirements for walls, floors, roof insulation or building services.

By using this method on the project, SBE was able to maximise the glazed area on the project while maintaining overall efficiency.
