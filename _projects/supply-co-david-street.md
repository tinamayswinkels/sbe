The project is to consist of an 11 storey development containing 64 x One Bedroom and 62 x Two Bedroom and 14 x 3 bedroom dwellings (140 dwellings in total). The prominent features of the development are:

* Lift access to be provided to all apartments
* A basement and ground level car park with 191 spaces
* 49 bicycle racks in the car parking areas
* Minimum of 3m<sup>3</sup> dedicated storage space for each apartment
* Every apartment has a balcony or yard
* One retail space&nbsp;
* Apartments incorporate shading (in some cases ‘operable’) and enhanced natural ventilation strategies.
* Dwellings will achieve an average 6.6 Stars energy rating.
* Reverse cycle split systems to each apartment will be specified to be within one star of highest available at time of purchase.
* Energy efficient fluorescent and LED lighting throughout all apartments and common areas.
* Minimum 4-star solar hot water storage with gas boost will supply domestic hot water to each dwelling and the tenancy
* Collection of rainwater for toilet flushing and irrigation.
* Bicycle parking provided to tenants.
* Retention of heritage listed components of the original fa&ccedil;ade.
* Energy – 40% improvement over conventional practice.
* Greenhouse Gas Emissions – The benchmark emissions for an equivalent conventional development are 7,959 kg/CO2/dwelling. The emissions target is 5,969 kg/CO2/dwelling and this development exceeds this with total emissions of 4,740kg/CO2/dwelling.
* Peak Demand 80.6% improvement over conventional practice.
* Water - 33% reduction in potable water use (25% minimum required by council). This will equate to an annual usage of around 95.6 kL of mains water per dwelling.
* Storm water - 106% STORM treatment will be achieved (100% minimum required by council)&nbsp;
