SBE has worked with PTA on a number of Aquatic Centres, providing advice on building fabric, daylighting, Building Code compliance, materials and water saving initiatives.  Recent projects have included WaterMarc, Sunshine Aquatic and the Doone Kennedy Aquatic Centre.

The Craigieburn Regional Aquatic & Leisure Centre (SPLASH) is to be completed in late 2017.

The modelled GHG emissions of the designed facility are **55% lower** than the GHG emissions of an equivalent reference building complying with the minimum Deemed-to-Satisfy provisions of NCC 2014 Section J.  This is a significant improvement upon the 25% reduction target outlined by Hume City Council Greenhouse Action Plan

It is also estimated that the facility will use **22.9L/visitor/day of potable water** which falls under the **Good** rating category (&lt;10-25L/patron) as per the Sydney Water guidelines for aquatic centres.  This is equivalent to potable water use of **6.6kL/m<sup>2</sup> pool area/year**.  The potable water use of existing operating aquatic centres in Victoria ranges between 3-29kL/m<sup>2</sup> pool area/year, with an average of 12kL//m<sup>2</sup> pool area/year.  With a potable water use of 6.6kL/m<sup>2</sup> pool area/year, the facility has the potential to place amongst the lowest users of potable water compared to other operating aquatic centres in Victoria
