This ten storey office building, part of a mixed-use development located between Flinders Street and the elevated rail tracks, achieved a 5 Star Green Star Office Design rating in early 2009.

As the appointed Green Star Accredited Professional, SBE assisted the design team throughout the Concept Design, Design Development and Construction phases. The projectâ€™s proximity to the Yarra River led to a focus on stormwater quality and water consumption with the specification of water efficient appliances, fixtures and fittings and the re-use of rainwater for toilet flushing.
