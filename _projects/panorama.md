The site is located within 500m of the Doncaster Shoppingtown Bus station and within the bounds of the Doncaster Hill Project.

Doncaster is at the heart of Melbourneâ€™s eastern corridor. The Doncaster Hill Strategy is a $2 billion initiative adopted by the Manningham City Council as a response to increased demand for more appropriate, sustainable and diverse

housing options that accommodate the municipality's changing demographic and social needs. The initiative is rejuvenating the city centre and creating a fresh new future for central Doncaster.

The Doncaster Hill Strategy was adopted in 2002 and provides a 20 year vision to create a mixed use sustainable urban village with medium to high density housing that is within walking distance to shops, restaurants and workplaces.
