Green Star Healthcare Design v1 2009&nbsp; 4 stars Auistraoian BEst Practice

&nbsp;

Air-conditioning systems are a VRV (Variable Refrigerant Volume) system. The VRV system generally comprises centralised air cooled outdoor units with multiple indoor Fan Coil Units (FCU’s). All Fan Coil Units are to be capable of independent heating and cooling. The VRV systems will generally be heat recovery type to allow for simultaneous heating and cooling to occur between separate FCU’s, thereby reducing the system energy requirements.

The indoor units are zoned to match the space thermal loads and room operational characteristics. In general, the areas served shall not exceed 100m2 for improved controllability and thermal comfort. Separate systems should be provided within each house. Separate systems should be provided for Common Areas and Bedrooms Areas. Individual in ceiling VRV ducted fan coil units shall be used to serve the bedrooms.

The outdoor units shall be sized and configured to meet the diversified whole of building peak cooling load.

The system COP for the VRV systems was based on the Mitsubishi Hi-COP R2 VRV system of 4.41 for cooling, and 4.49 for heating, as confirmed by the mechanical services consultants (Appendix I).

Fresh air is ducted to the back of fan coil units throughout the building via a centralised ducted system. Fresh air will be generally precooled/heated by Heat recovery units located at roof level. The heat recovery units will utilise the toilet exhaust to provide a degree of precooling/heating and DX coils shall operate as require maintaining a constant air off temperature. These units shall operate 24/7 to maintain constant building ventilation

Energy Calculator for the proposed building estimates annual greenhouse emissions of 351,172 kg CO2/m2/year.&nbsp; 44.6% reduction
