The project consists of a 4 storey development containing 34 apartments with integrated car and bike parking, a balcony for each apartment and a roof top deck for common access.

SBE was appointed to provide full ESD Consultancy services from Town Planning through to Building Permit and final energy ratings.&nbsp; &nbsp;

* Energy – 28% improvement over conventional practice (25% minimum required).
* Greenhouse Gas Emissions – The benchmark emissions for an equivalent conventional development are 7,727 kg/CO2/dwelling. The emissions target is 5,795 kg/CO2/dwelling and this development exceeds this with total emissions of 5,584 kg/CO2/dwelling.
* Energy Peak Demand reduction of 65.1%.
* Water - 37% reduction in potable water use (25% minimum required by council) including 20,000L of rainwater capture, storage and reuse for toilet flushing. This will equate to an annual saving of around 44 kL of mains water per dwelling.
* Storm water - 100% STORM score which will remove 45% or more of the nitrogen contamination from the stormwater leaving the site.

The building achieved an average final energy rating of 7.55 stars, with 10 of the dwellings rating at over 8 stars.

The presence of a roof top deck for all residents, a large central light court as well as the close proximity to bus services, the Northcote aquatic centre and High street in Northcote makes this an attractive development for residents.
