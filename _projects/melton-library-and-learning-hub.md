SBE was employed by the Melton Shire council to Peer review and assist with the Green Star Design Submission (by Murchie Consulting) and was then employed by the builder (ADCO) to assist in collecting and compiling the evidence for an As-Built Green Star Submission. Both Green Star submissions were successful.
