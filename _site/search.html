    "body": "2021/04/28 - Week 3:  A week of information overload, here it goes…   To begin with, Sean gave us a quick overview of the NCC volume one 2019 standard considered as the rule book for energy efficiency for buildings. We also had an opportunity to go through the Section-J DTS provisions and understand them thoroughly. We then kicked off our Bacchus Marsh Sports Precinct project, the sports centre building is a ground-floor structure with a fancy facade with provisions for skylight, it also has horizontal and vertical overhangs. Rob briefed us on the project and explained the various building fabric elements as per DTS requirements stated under NCC 2019. We began with roof and floor assemblies referencing the building structure for the R-value calculations. These assemblies were based on Rob’s explanation on the considerations required for R-value calculations including different layers of material, insulation, DTS build roof and floor requirements. We then moved onto the Window to Wall ratio calculations using the new facade calculator developed by ABCB, the videos posted by ABCB on how to use the facade calculator definitely helped with this task. This calculator compares the wall and glazing U Values of the proposed design to the DTS reference of NCC 2019 J1. 5 Building fabric provisions. We successfully managed to complete the facade calculations by the end of day one, but unfortunately the east orientation of the building was non-compliant against the DTS requirements for the wall and glazing U-value and solar admittance. Day 2,To tackle the problem of non-compliance we took an alternative approach and used JV3 modelling. Given that the building had a complex facade and geometry, we spent almost the entire day modelling the building using the IES VE tool. Sean helped us on a few occasions around the critical geometry of the building which got us through to complete the daylight modelling for the project, finally… In the coming week we plan to get our heads around JV3 modelling… Stay tuned!   "

Our next day was super lit!  We carried out the daylight analysis for the apartments. Sean patiently taught us to carry out the task. Most of the apartments we modelled met the desired threshold but not enough. We brainstormed methods to improve the daylighting and presented the ideas to the architect for their consideration. We then moved on to our next project which required preliminary energy ratings to be done. It was for a large multi storey residential building located in Footscray. We had some concerns in achieving the cooling loads, but Rob was our saviour and helped us through it. The apartments passed the assessments and we got them to a 7. 7 star average. Finally we got to go for our first site visit. Steve Kasinski, the project architect from PTA, volunteered to take us on the site for the nearly completed leisure centre in East Keilor.   The client is the Moonee Valley City Council. The site visit was a rewarding experience.   The process, the engagement between the architects, builders, project managers, site supervisors was very revealing. Be it the age-old fight between engineers and architects, his experiences of the projects or even cricket; Steve lead us on some very engaging conversations to and from the site!It was a long week and full of learning; new adventures and an adrenaline rush to meet the deadlines!   "

The Interns will focus on learning new software, environmentally sustainable design techniques, and collaborative learning. Working together as a team, they will focus on various rating tools and standards along with town planning to develop a sustainable community.   Learn more about Pooja and Prat as they introduce themselves: Pratidnya Bhuite:  Hi! it’s Pratidnya but you can call me Prat!  Must say I am super excited to join SBE after the Pandemic which has in some or the other way affected everyone around the world. With a good positive start this year, I am hoping to learn and progress forward within the field of sustainable development that I am really passionate about. Coming from a civil engineering background and having experience with the National Green building rating body of India the GRIHA Council, I am excited to move into the Australian market of the built environment and learn new skills during this internship.   I Believe in modern principles and practices of civil engineering especially in the area of sustainability within the construction industry and its application in projects which advocate sustainable development — SBE’s internship program perfectly aligns with my career goals and the vision of my personal mission and purpose.   Pooja Vaidya:  Hello Everyone I am Pooja being an architect I am eager on the design side of the buildings but with the sustainability major I also would like to engage into practical association of the both while interning with SBE and Peddle Thorp group.   I would like to ensure I get involved with all kinds of projects and get a major hands on experience regarding the Green Buildings and other efficiency tools. This week has been productive as we start with our training on FR5 tools along with an amazing lunch with the team and discussion on the different climate zones of Victoria on day one followed by hands-on experience on the FR5 tool. Day 2 begins with an introduction to BESS rating tool and training on the BESS assessment for a mixed-use development. And here we get our 1st project to work, the 367 KEILOR RD project for BESS assessment along with FR5 use for NatHERS rating and more to come… Stay posted on this blog for our progress on the 1st project!! -- Thanks &amp; Regards, Pratidnya Bhuite   "

    "body": "2020/03/26 - Our final week began with continuing our NCC study, combing through both the 2016 and 2019 NCC documents looking for changes to section J. The model was remade countless times in IES and extensive time was spent on glazing and façade calculators. The current results of the study indicate that the 2019 NCC criteria are stricter in some aspects, however allows greater flexibility in design. Here are some key points we have discovered thus far:  The new façade calculator allows for more flexible design through trading off window and wall performance. Performance can also be traded off between different façade orientations/ levels. In general the 2019 calculator requires higher performing materials to meet minimum criteria.  The new façade calculator now assesses all levels of a building and has only 4 orientations compared to the previous 8. While these changes make the calculator easier to use, this reduction in complexity may result in less optimized solutions.  There are some minor changes to insulation values in areas such as roof and walls. These changes however did not affect our project.  Energy usage is now required to be measured in greenhouse gas emission equivalent.  The new code also introduces a thermal comfort requirement. This week we participated in a site visit to the Eastland council office extension, this project was further developed than our previous site visits. Here we were able to witness insulation, glazing and HVAC installation. We sat in on discussions with contractors regarding feasibility of interior design materials. To finish the week we began another IES VE JV3 assessment of a sports precinct, after our student housing project we were very relieved to have a single story project that our computers can handle. We are much more comfortable with this project after our previous experience with the student housing project and our NCC study. Huge thanks to Sean, Rob and the whole Peddle Thorp team for being so welcoming, this internship has been more valuable than any classes we have taken at university. It has been a great chance to deliver real ESD reports, NatHERS assessments, JV3 analysis, waste management plans, storm water analysis and assisting with achieving council approval. It was fantastic to get some hands on experience with tools such as IES VE, FirstRate 5, BESS and STORM and a taste of the Green Star assessment process.      Unfortunately this may also be the end of Broderick’s soccer career with the Peddle Thorp team with an undefeated streak since joining the team, if Broderick is around on Tuesdays he may make occasional cameo appearances. While our internship has sadly come to an end we will be popping around the office to complete our NCC study and work on some projects.     "

    "body": "2020/02/06 - Hit the booksThis week began with finalizing our Student housing town planning project; we completed the STORM and BESS assessments and prepared the client’s report. As mentioned last week the project is passing all criteria except daylighting, the building design will likely need to be altered accordingly. In an attempt to pass the daylighting criteria we ran the assessment again with the project as a class 2 building. A class 2 building requires 0. 5% daylighting factor (DF) in bedrooms and 1% DF in living rooms, whereas a class 3 building requires 2% DF in all transient living areas. With these changes the project was able to pass, we are now in discussions with the client on how to proceed.   Early this week we completed another residential town planning project. We are now getting quite comfortable with FirstRate5 NatHERS assessments and did not need to ask Rob/Sean for help so much. This was also our first project to require a waste management plan in compliance with the City of Melbourne’s guidelines. This week we also were able to accompany Peddle Thorp’s team on a site visit to the East Keilor Leisure Centre. On our site visit we attended a meeting with the project manager, contractors, engineers and the council, this meeting mostly consisted of discussing feasibility of designs, delivery dates and resolving conflicts between architectural and structural designs Following the meeting we witnessed the foundation preparation for the leisure centre’s pools. For the latter half of this week we have been burying our noses in NCC 2019, NCC 2016, Guide to NCC 2019, Handbook Energy Efficiency NCC 2019…. Trying to wrap our brains around the upcoming implementation of NCC 2019, particularly section J. One of the major changes we are looking into is how façades and glazing are now treated as a whole. It is interesting to see how you can trade off the performance of glazing with walls to achieve minimum requirements. At a first view the new code appears to be more stringent but allows greater design flexibility.   This week closed with a briefing from Rob regarding Passive House (Passivhaus), Rob was able to give us some insights into the criteria to achieve certification and the design principles of Passive House. Next week we hope to further study the NCC 2019, we are currently producing a deemed to satisfy (DTS) building to both the 2016 and 2019 standards. We plan on testing how each standard will perform thermally and hope to publish the results. We also plan to touch on more Green Star and WELL with Sean also meet with superstar ex SBE intern Leah to learn of Rhino and Grasshopper. More to come… "

    "body": "2020/01/31 - Week 3   After a lovely long weekend, we have come back to hit the ground running. Jumping straight into the deep end we modelled our student housing project in IES. This project is a JV3 assessment which requires us to model the building thermals and daylighting with the Apache and FlucsDL extensions to the IES VE program. There were numerous troubles with developing a Deemed to Satisfy (DTS) model, with issues such as: modelling, assigning usage profiles, weather and materials to the construction. It was interesting to note how student housing is a NCC class 3 building and how it affects the design requirements in terms of daylighting and building usage. Alas we finally made it through and were able to compare the DTS building with our improved design which is passing all requirements except daylighting. We look forward to discussing with other stakeholders how to assess this issue as more windows will increase daylighting however also will increase the cost and thermal demand. In our spare time we worked on another NatHERS firstrate5 assessment/ Town planning project which we are aiming to complete early next week. We also had the opportunity to sit in on a Green Star interiors meeting. Here we learned the difficulty of chasing up evidence for approval and how the Green Star application process is not so straight forward and has some leniency for negotiation. It was interesting to see how the differing parties of builders, contractors and ESD consultants were able to negotiate how the project will be completed. Also in exciting news the Peddle Thorp soccer team has won their first soccer game this season with our Broderick kicking a whole ONE goal. We are excited for next week. More to come…     "

    "body": "2020/01/23 - Week 2 Down to business Our second week at SBE has already come to end; time is flying by so fast… It has been an exciting and busy week, to say the least. This week we had a more hands on approach to learning, beginning with projects then learning the skills we need to complete them. We were assigned two town planning projects; a class 3 student housing and a class 1a multi-dwelling (townhouse) development. Our week began with battling over gets to use the single software license for daylight modelling within IES VE. While we had access Sean taught us the basics and we were able to investigate the daylighting performance impacts of variables such as window placement, orientation, material properties and shade. The student housing project terrifies both of us so we decided to pick our battles and start with the townhouse project. We conducted First Rate 5 energy assessments on the dwellings and we were both pleased and relieved to reach the minimum NatHERS star rating requirement for the project. With balancing heating and cooling demand along with insights from Rob regarding placement and types of insulation we were able to achieve a 6. 6 star rating. To complete this planning project we also needed to complete a Built Environment Sustainability Scorecard (BESS) to comply with council level regulations. BESS assesses ESD performance under nine key criteria (Energy, Indoor Environment Quality (IEQ), Water, Stormwater, Management, Urban Ecology, Transport, Waste and Innovation). For the BESS assessment we needed to provide our NatHERS ratings, calculate a ‘STORM Score’ with the Melbourne Water STORM tool and collect/ provide all relevant data. With a passing BESS we were then able to complete our first report ready for clients. The NCC class 3 student housing facility has different requirements to the smaller scale residential projects we have completed thus far. We are currently trying flesh out the skills we need for this project, such as daylight modelling and studying the National Construction Code so we are ready to learn JV3 modelling. With these skills hopefully we are ready to take on the student housing project. More to come… "

We had the pleasure of having coffee with previous SBE intern, now Peddle Thorp star employee, Leah Tausan. Leah helped us get a feel for what to expect and strive for throughout our internship. We then created goals and targets for the internship with a rough timeline of events. Through our internship we aim to learn key ESD software packages, how to write ESD reports, further understand energy efficient ratings included in the NCC and GreenStar and each have personal projects. This week has been appropriately named First Rate week. Rob has been kind enough to put up with us learning the basics of his favourite program First Rate 5. In our spare time we have also been tasked to try to self-learn the IES VE software package which we will be touching in greater detail next week. A key skill of an ESD consultant is plan reading, Sean put our skills to test with through a large set of plans for a proposed aquatic centre. Our search through the plans required us to read through architectural, mechanical, hydraulic, electrical and even ask for more plans. On Wednesday we had the opportunity to tag along with Anthony and Alan for a site visit to Toyota’s alterations to their powertrain facility in Altona. Here we got to witness the different opinions of the stakeholders involved and how conflicts of interest were resolved. Here we were also able to ask Anthony and Alan questions regarding the typical responsibilities expected throughout the design and construction process. We discussed some of the design elements which allowed this facility to achieve a GreenStar rating. Finally, our week brought us to our first project…. We have each been given 2 properties to conduct a NATHERS assessment for the upcoming ‘The Block’ TV season. We are currently trying to put our newfound First Rate 5 skills to use and pestering Rob just the right amount. We look forward to our future weeks at SBE More to come… "

We will be running this blog and interning until Rob inevitably gets sick of us and takes leave in February. We are writing this blog today while the IT mastermind Elio sets us up to begin work. Introducing: Lakshmee Rajpati: Lakshmee Rajpati was born in Mauritius her hobbies include baking sweets, travelling and photography. Lakshmee travelled to the UK to study energy engineering with environmental management at the university of East Anglia. Post graduate Lakshmee fled the cold of the UK and returned to the cosy Mauritius weather. For two years Lakshmee worked several roles in project management, consultancy and research. With a desire to enter the sustainability industry Lakshmee moved to Melbourne last year to begin her master’s degree in energy efficient and sustainable buildings at RMIT. Broderick Jacobs: Broderick Jacobs was raised in Bendigo, central Victoria. In Broderick’s spare time he enjoys lazing around the house consuming media, going to music concerts and playing soccer. After high school Broderick moved to Melbourne for the coffee culture and also to study a bachelor’s degree in sustainable systems engineering. Through Broderick’s studies he gained a passion for the ESD industry which has now brought him to SBE. We are very grateful to SBE and Peddle Thorp for this opportunity, we will try to make the most of it. During our stay here we aim to learn the ins and outs of the ESD industry, software packages such as FirstRate 5, IES VE and to test the capabilities of the fancy coffee machine. "

    "body": "2019/03/05 - Millie **Let the good times roll! ** It’s finally my turn to say goodbye. Dramatically false alarmed everyone thinking my last day was on a Thursday (28 Feb) that is the last day of February whilst Sean actually planned for a Friday. Typical intern drama haha. This week is a first taste of working a 5-day week with SBE and I’ve been kept busy. With the completion of 577 Little Collins Street report draft sent out to PTA Alex, (that took a bit longer than expected because it was a green star design and built template, something new to learn), I’ve alongside written a cover email drawing attention to the high glazing performance requirement (of course directly quoting Sean, but nevertheless I would say it’s an evident improvement in my ability to write formal emails). Ending 577 Little Collins Street on a Tuesday, I have allowed the rest of the week for a new project, that is my last one with SBE, 83 Sydney Road mixed development in Brunswick. The client is aware of the development’s short in dimensions of lightwells per the requirement of the local council and hence required a daylighting assessment, together with standard ESD reports and online BESS. Sydney Road, Brunswick, Daylighting = Yay! I live in the northern suburbs and Sydney Road is where the vibes are. Working on a project near your neighborhood is just so much fun coz you get to see the proposed development before everyone else sees it (then you can tell your neighbors, hey the Vietnamese baguette shop might be turned into a 5-story residential!) Ah wells. Since this is my last blog, I really feel the need to sum up everything I’ve learnt and experienced in the past 12 weeks. Software: IES-VE  From academic knowledge and basic application to having the confidence to ‘fix a broken model myself’ because ‘I’ve got this’.  From experiencing 40+ errors in 1 model and spending half a day fixing it to ‘the model has 0 errors’ and is ‘ready to run daylighting’ in first attempt From thermal data not making sense and apache failing to “results comply let’s write the report” in first attemptFirstRate5  From requesting for more FR5 projects coz “I’m not good at it’ to “FR5 is a relatively easy software compared to IES” From “breaking all the models Rob passed me” to “let’s see how we can get this to 6 stars” From “what’s wrong with me coz all computers hate me” to “ah it must be that issue again. I know what’s wrong!”Council Submissions and Reports  Understanding how to put bits and pieces together to complete a BESS report, i. e. , Melbourne Stormwater Calculator, (which I have never used before) NatHERs results, identifying cross-ventilated rooms, Green Star potable water calculator, waste management plan, green travel plans etc.  While the two software were like an *improvement* process, I feel like learning about reports is something *new* and doing things that I’ve never done before. Oscar, Sean and Rob  From questioning our self-worth as an intern to really feeling as a part of the SBE team.  From strangers to coworkers that turned into Linkedin and Facebook connections that I will happily and definitely keep in touch wherever I go. *****Yay! SBE! ***** Thank you for having us for the past 12 weeks! "

    "body": "2019/02/24 - SBE Intern Blog Moving on to new things Oscar: My time at SBE has sadly come to an end. It’s absolutely crazy how quickly 3 months can pass (and how big a Nutella calzone really is – but more on that later). In my last week at SBE I worked four days, with the first giving Sean and Rob a tutorial on how to use MUSIC and how to draft an SMP report. Trying to keep things as bite sized as possible, we managed to get through the day with as little confusion as possible, and throughout the remainder of the week they have both been working on their first MUSIC models. Outside of this, I’ve been working hard to tie up loose ends so I don’t leave my work unfinished, and the things I’ve created for SBE are put to good use. All my work (touching up the energy tool, the water calculator, the MUSIC help documents, etc. ) have now been fully explained in SBE project folders so that when Sean and Roberto get back to them, they know what’s going on. I hope my impact has been helpful to some regard! Back to the calzone, today (Friday) we’ve had the privilege of Sean and Roberto taking us out for a final lunch together. After having some beautiful food and wine, we were able to reflect on what a great experience these three months has been for all of us, not just us interns. I think it’s safe to say that we all left this experience richer than before. I especially left that lunch about 3kg heavier than before, after underestimating the size of a Nutella calzone!! A very big thank you to not only SBE, but the Peddle Thorp group for being so accommodating throughout my time here. I have felt very welcomed in this group, and have thoroughly enjoyed my time gaining the experience I hope to project me to the next part of my career. Until next time! Millie **Wishing Oscar all the best for his future endeavors! ** This week has been a celebration week – not because Oscar is leaving and I’m sadly left alone (it really makes a difference having a fellow SBE intern at work) but because it’s internship completion for both of us and new page of life starts for Oscar! I’m really excited for him as he is such an amazing companion and I can’t wait to hear from him about his amazing world tours ahead. Work wise, this week has unfortunately been slow mainly coz I’m sick. (I really don’t feel sick but the morning sneeze and my throat think otherwise). Continuing with 577 Little Collins Street, again got caught up with studio lofts fully glazed to 3 sides of its façade because the most efficient glazing available in the FR5 system can only bump the apartments up to 4. 8 stars, (needs a minimum of 5 stars to pass for individual apartment units, while all of them have to make up an average of 6). Briefly mentioned it to Rob and I’m sure he’ll definitely come up with something. (working the Rob magic) IES wise the software has not been kind Sean and myself by some unexplained “non-socketing errors”, which forgive me, I don’t even understand what does that mean. Luckily Sean fixed it while I and Oscar sneaked out to do some shopping for our internship completion. Turns out one of the lofts was boiling at 90 degrees and it could be one of the reasons why the model failed. This week has been shortened into 2 days that has kept me very busy, something I enjoy coz time goes by really quick but imposed a bit of challenge to progress as well, especially when it comes to unexplained model fails. Always been grateful that whenever these occur our mentors Sean and Rob never leave us alone. "

    "body": "2019/02/15 - SBE Intern Blog Nearing the end Oscar: With the end of my time at SBE become more and more tangible (two weeks left!), I have had to think about how I want to leave SBE. In doing so, I don’t want to leave things unfinished, and I want my work to be useful to both Sean and Roberto once I leave. Consequently, this week I have prioritised what needs to be completed by next Friday. Over the coming week, I hope to bring Sean and Roberto up to speed on the inner workings of MUSIC, how it works and generating the SMP reports. This has taken quite some time to do so far, requiring significant research into how certain compliance checks are calculated. I can begin to understand why the training course exists, however for town planning purposes only; it would be impractical to know the entirety of the MUSIC tool. As a result of making it easier for both Sean and Roberto, I have generated a User’s Guide, a SMP (stormwater management plan) template, a database of other tools and manuals, and an excel calculator to compare 1. 5 ARI flows for town planning (requirement which cannot be simply calculated in MUSIC). It’s been quite liberating to be able to explore the program and hopefully I can effectively teach Sean and Roberto next week! Outside of MUSIC, I have tackled a few more projects this week, as well as chipping away at Roberto’s Energy Audit Tool. I hope to run through the auditing tool with him later next week so we’re on the same page, and so that he has no trouble making any adjustments if need be. Currently it has been improved to fix a few formulas, make it more users friendly and produce an energy audit pdf report once the audit is complete. I’m looking forward to what the coming week brings, and excited for what’s in store afterwards! Millie Getting there but still lots to learn – Week without Rob :’( After opening a cans of worms for the Casey green project, I couldn’t wait till Rob come back to discuss the FR5 energy modelling results – unfortunately he’s having a week off, so all my unsettled traumas have all been suspended.   This week has been quiet, for some odd reasons, it’s either Valentine’s day or the cold weather (12 degrees every morning I get up!) With Rob away I’ve been taking his seat (to avoid all Millie-related computer crashes), commencing on 577 Little Collins Street ESDS, daylighting and JV3 assessments. If you guys remember my SBE first-born baby the Epping Private Hospital project which Oscar innocently exclaimed ‘WOW! It’s been a month you’re on that’, as we were catching up and he’s on project no. 10 and I’m still putting windows on the model, 577 is a similar project in terms of its computer crashing abilities – except there’s far less to model as most of the floors are typical so it’s just lots of copy and paste work. The learning of this project would be putting in adjacent buildings for an accurate simulation of daylight obstruction. Really fun, when you look up google map and simply surround your building with a bunch of buildings of similar height &gt;=80m and now pray to IES that there will be some kind of daylight penetration through – first-world issues of living in the CBD I suppose. Reminded me of living in the CBD during my student years and I was staying in this bedroom with NO windows and the adverse effect it had on my sleep and biological clock that eventually prompted me to move. Whilst SBE is carefully looking into living spaces and bedrooms to ensure they’re all having sufficient daylighting, left me wondering how on earth did the building I lived in went through town planning – 915 Little Collins Street it was. I have encountered questions from people in the industry wondering the importance of ESD, given all the financial benefits and huge savings on operational cost, it really goes back to home owners wanting to go home to enjoy a place where they spent most of their savings on feeling comfortable, and ESD addresses that. Trust me; you really wouldn’t want to stay in a bedroom with no windows. "

    "body": "2019/02/10 - SBE Intern Blog (6 Feb 2019) Oscar: Starting to hear the MUSIC This week, the fully licences MUSIC program was finally purchased for SBE, and it was my role to understand it as best I can. I decided to tackle this task by working on a project with the program, whilst writing a ‘users guide’ for Sean and Roberto alongside whenever I noticed something of interest. It’s a very user intensive program, requiring significant inputs about the site and proposed treatment measures to allow the program to run properly. Put these requirements alongside the individual council’s requirements, and the program becomes fairly complex! Nonetheless, it’s been great to slowly determine the ins and outs of the software, and apply it to a project. Different to STORM, when using MUSIC you can look at ‘bigger picture’ stormwater treatment measures on larger projects, such as stormwater wetlands, detention tanks, etc. Outside of working with MUSIC this week, I was also adjusted some older BESS reports which have come back with design changes. Besides that, the main focus has been working on MUSIC! As always, I’m looking forward to what next week brings. Millie We opened a can of worms, Rob! (Just being fair, Sean got featured last week) This week marks the commencement of the Casey Green Precinct project – challenging much as it involves 5 types of townhouses in different positions and orientations. (Apartments coming soon!) In order to get an accurate representation of energy simulation results for each of the units (we’re using FR5 for town planning submissions), we spent some time on grouping them in types, by their positions (corner vs middle) and their orientations. That equals to 5 x 2 x 2 = around 20 townhouse units required for simulation, as much as I’m happy with the simplicity of doing 1 base case for each type, then adding windows for the corner types ( x 2), then spinning them around to their opposite orientations (x 2), essentially 20 models is still quite a lot of work. (Not complaining since I looked at Oscar’s MUSIC software and I think I got the easier task, having said that Oscar helped me with 4 models). So this is the sequence of how we gradually opened a can of worms: As Oscar is a more efficient modeler than I am, he finished 4 of the models first, and gave me a template of the construction material performance specifications. Without further discussing with Rob (tell me why I didn’t ask), I proceeded to apply the construction template to 20 models Results seem good showing 6. 2-7. 5 Nathers Star rating, I was already working on the report marking down heating and cooling loads One of the corner townhouses got 5. 8 Nathers Star rating, fell below the minimum requirement for compliance of 6 stars. Rob and I redesigned the construction material performance specs in order to make the worst performing townhouse comply – during the process we’ve taking out ceiling insulation that I’ve wrongly added because they shouldn’t be required between partitions of 2 conditioned spaces, which implies the other constructions have to improve in performance. I reapplied the latest construction template to all models – stuck with one of them that fell down to 5. 1 Star instead of improving, most likely due to excessive exposed ceiling and floor area compared to other units, so this has now become our worst performance unit.  Repeat step 4-6. I hope Rob doesn’t come back next week to too nasty a surprise :\ "

    "body": "2019/02/06 -   Previews of all volumes of the NCC2019 have been published and can be downloaded from the ABCB website. As previously mentioned Section J Energy Efficiency incorporates a number of changes including variations to performance requirements, calculations methods, and acceptable verification method pathways and associated protocols. Here we summarise some of the major changes included in Section J of Volume One. Verification Methods Three new verification methods have been included. These are JV1 NABERS Energy for Offices, JV2 Green Star and JV4 Building envelope sealing. The inclusion of the first two pathways helps streamlining the assessment requirements, thus reducing the doubling up in simulation protocols. The last method, namely JV4, helps assessing with greater certainty compliance with the building sealing provisions of Part J3. Further, in recognition of the importance to design and build buildings that are energy efficient AND comfortable for their occupants, the Verification Method JV1, JV2 and JV3 include a requirement to demonstrate that PMV levels of -1 to +1 are achieved across at least 95% of the floor area of occupied zoned for not less than 98% of the annual operating hours. Roof Lights The table outlining the performance requirements for roof lights has been simplified. In this version of the NCC the Total U-value for roof lights is 3. 9 regardless of the roof light / floor are ratio, while the total SHGC remains a function of shaft index and roof light / floor are ratio (even though overall the requirements have been tighten). Walls and Glazing As mentioned in a previous article Part J2 has been removed and glazing provisions are now included in Part J1. 5. This requires walls and glazing to be assessed together as part of a wall-glazing construction that must comply with the specified Total U-value, SHGCs and solar admittance values. Floors The table specifying the performance requirements for floors has been simplified with only two types nominated: (1) floors without an in-slab heating or cooling system and (2) floors with an in-slab heating or cooling system.  Further, slab on ground are now required to achieve a Total R-value in all climate zones.   "

    "body": "2019/02/03 -   MillieAwkward moment when you’ve completed your work and then what? “Sean, can you please tell me how do I hand this in to Stephen?”  Dumb question,  yes I feel stupid when I asked too. BUT I’m gonna forgive myself (as usual) and this blog will explain why. SO, upon completion of the Epping Private Hospital Project, I’m ready to hand in my ESD report to HSPC Stephen officially– exciting times! Wait, HOW?What uni never could have taught you …Dating back to happy sweet uni days, you’ve finished your kick-arse piece of assignment then you’ve got to hand it in, what do you do? Go turnitin. com, make sure there’s no plagiarism involved, hit the submit button, DONE. But when it comes to the working environment, there’s no submit buttons. How do you submit your completed work to your client whom probably paid a few grands for it when 1) as much as you would like to tell them how awesome the building design is, the fact is some parts of the ESD results failed? 2) Again, HOW DO YOU TELL THEM THAT?I’ve found myself scratching my head and unhappy with my drafted email coz it just doesn’t sound good enough – therefore the question to Sean. And of course, - he wrote it instead. (just kidding, he walked me through it). I have never expected the need to learn to write an email throughout my internship experience (we didn’t set learning goals on this one, no?), and to me this is as overwhelming as learning to model the whole hospital itself, because simple as it is, it is so skilful almost a piece of art – on delivering professional service, helping your client to achieve their objectives, while presenting them honest results. This happened on Wednesday. While Thursday I and Oscar did a town planning application  for a multi-unit apartment building in 1 day, and Friday we’re working with Ric on the Casey Green precinct development, looking forward to all the challenges anticipated!  OscarA small rush period, and moving on to new things:This week my work was much more varied, it was great to see what else was out there in terms of ESD work. I started by assisting Rob with his energy audit calculator, first by correcting some accidental mistakes, I moved on to looking how to generate a report format within the calculator so that SBE could save time when doing building energy audits. Having worked on this throughout the week, I definitely know that it’s going to take some time. But nonetheless it will be exciting to see how it turns out!Aside from helping Rob, Millie and I were tasked with a last minute job in Kensington (the basic SMP report along with a waste management plan and potable water calculator). It seems the bills were due by the 31st, and Sean must’ve been off spending SBE’s budget on his Friday steak lunch again, so a rush to get a little extra money in the account was upon us. But alas, Millie and I were able to rise to the occasion, finish the report in time and Sean didn’t go hungry today.  Finally, I downloaded Melbourne Water’s intricate stormwater quantity and quality assessment tool ‘MUSIC’. After playing around on the (extremely limited) trial version, I was able to understand the program and its benefits. Hopefully SBE can get the full version for their business; it will probably be of great assistance!Looking forward to the next week as always.   "

    "body": "2019/01/25 -   Understanding things a little clearer: OscarStarting on the 21st, I entered this week with multiple projects to complete. Over the four days, I completed BESS and JV3 assessments for a Scout hall in Denmark (WA), a school sports hall in Armadale and a townhouse development in Bulleen. It’s been great to not only see these projects through from start to finish, but begin to see the difference in approaches for each project, and how they can affect the overall outcome in design. Beginning to see the ‘bigger picture’ in these reports and assessments rather than seeing them as simple reports to be finished has allowed me to be more critical of these developments, especially which aspects are ‘non-negotiable’.  As well as exploring these assessments further, I was able to finish a first draft/test of my water calculator. Playing around with it through the week has led to some frustration but also excitement. It’s good to see it get used finally.  We shall see what next week brings! Don’t think I’ve ever crossed my fingers so hard (and so frequently)…. . Millie If you have been following this blog, or ran into me when I was getting my coffee whenever my computer crashes, and I have been ranting to you about my Epping Private Hospital project - This is the week when all of us in SBE joined efforts to help me finish it up (coz it took me SO LONG). Team effort is always appreciated.  The week started off with my daylighting simulation crashed, resulting in a loss of a small portion of work, (alongside with lots of weird model bugs) and as a result I had to bury my head into fixing them. (bugs include the model self-generating windows I’ve never put in and spreaded like a disease to all 4 floors!) From being really excited to building models this week I started to wanna finish it instead, after all due date is close. The completion of this project (or just passing it on to my poor SBE supervisors) has made me realized:1.    Believe it or not: I actually have a talent in fixing models (or of course ruining them) From in the beginning it was such a chore now I’m just like, ok give it to me. I volunteer to debug all IES-model errors from now on. I really don’t hate it.  2.    As much as I love the Epping Private Hospital Project, I can’t wait to start a new one coz this is heart attack hospital project since the IES software seems to really hate it and I need to cross all my fingers. 3.    1st simulation worked in Apache (thermal simulations) with NO errors. I had to say I’m a little proud coz normally it takes a few runs and errors till it start running.  This week’s work is as dramatic as the heat outside, from being really rushed to start energy simulations just two days ago, to finishing draft reports taking only 2 days, this project has been a steep learning curve ever since it has been handed over to me and I’m guessing (and wishing) the upcoming ones will be cakes!  "

    "body": "2019/01/18 - Getting into the thick of things: Oscar: The week starting the 14th has seen me heavily involved in the Clara Street project in South Yarra. Seeing it through from start to finish involved First Rate analysis, STORM assessments and the drafting of the BESS report. Once the report was finished, I was able to send the draft to the client and continue consultation with them about what changes might be required in the design to pass the ESD requirements when it’s submitted to town planning. This was a great learning experience as it further allowed me to see how multi-faceted these projects are, and how many stakeholders are involved. These complications can lead to many design changes in the modelling front; just speak to Millie about that! Today (Friday) I’ve been able to spend an hour so continuing the water calculator program, toying further with how information should be presented. Hopefully by the time I’m finished here it’s developed into something that Sean and Roberto can use to present information in their reports. Starting to appreciate the regularity of façade design … I was continuing with the Epping Private Hospital project this week. Façade and glazing has been primarily confirmed with the architects (Stephen &amp; Lauren) and the week started off seeing myself repetitively putting in finalised windows into the energy software IES. Copying and pasting was actually A LOT OF EFFORT! (While you are happily copying and pasting windows and did it for 100 times, then all of a sudden wake up and discover 1 irregular window and started questioning all l the work you’ve done in the past hour) I blame it on the computer! Of course! ;) Had an initial chat with Stephen and Lauren and tried to explain to them what a BESS assessment is (BESS actually stands for Built Environment Sustainability Scorecard, I didn’t even know oops) Not surprisingly I did a questionable job since I later found Sean and Rob chatting to Stephen for another half an hour (oh no) when I was going upstairs coz coffee machine ran out of milk. HOWEVER, what I’ve learnt from (trying to) explain town planning requirements to the architects while their client is aiming an absolute minimum ESD target. Show them what the minimum is if there is a requirement (I’ve passed them the completed stormwater report). Some of the requirements do have alternative compliance means (e. g. MUSIC assessment for stormwater) and it is possible for clients to change their mind or seek help from their service engineer to achieve those. (no need to stress or beat yourself up!) When in doubt, seek help from your boss. (IMPORTANT LESSON LEARNT) [editor’s note - Our discussion with upstairs was about big picture and future work with HSPC so its all good news Millie!]. Also would really wanna thank Lauren and Stephen for being SUPER helpful in my attempt to complete my first ESD report.  Look at this beast I’ve built from scratch :D "

    "body": "2019/01/11 - Coming back from the Christmas break  Oscar:After a nice summer break, the lure of the air-conditioned offices at 525 Flinders Street grew stronger as the hot summer continued.  Since coming back to work on Wednesday, I’ve had the opportunity to complete my first project from start to finish. Having started the modelling for a childcare facility in Malvern in 2018, I was able to complete the BESS assessment for the development. This included Daylight modelling in Fluchs, Energy assessment in Apache and using the STORM tool. As certain aspects of the development failed, alterations needed to be suggested to the architects in order to allow it to pass the threshold requirements. After continuing with appropriate changes, the development passed the BESS scorecard, and we have subsequently sent a draft report to the client for review (pending the changes being accepted).  Another exciting prospect of coming back to work was being able to continue work on the Water Tank Size Calculator that Millie and I have been working on. A continuing project, the calculator assesses all relevant site data within a development and calculates the required tank size and suitability to cater to the demand on site (i. e. toilet flushing, irrigation needs, etc. ). As a working progress, it has been great to slowly chip away at the program to test its useability, and refine its interface such that the information is presented in an easy to understand manner. Over the next few weeks we hope to produce something that could be used by SBE for their reports in the future! Starting a new year in SBE (not that we’ve been here for a year but…) Millie:A 2-week break is probably a good time for me to have forgotten everything I’ve learnt in SBE previously, (sorry!) given that I’ve had spectacular holiday (Still remembering when the 7th hit and I was so glad I start work on a Wednesday). Anyways, time to work! Once I’ve got back onto it, the new project I’ve been assigned is actually pretty exciting since I’ve got to work on a full ESD project by myself with HSPC Lauren and Stephen. Since daylight modelling is about looking into functional rooms to assure that they receive their share of daylight of a minimum of 2% compared to the overcast sky outside (important knowledge gained as I’ve never looked into what a DF=2 means apart from the fact that it is an obligatory requirement), the modelling task of the Epping Private hospital project was to firstly divide functional spaces and non-functional spaces, looked into building façade glazing, and finally assigning shading to eliminate glare and direct unpleasant sunlight.  Given the number of rooms a 4-storey, 2-stage hospital could have, most of my time spent on modelling was counting and dividing up rooms, (didn’t count the rooms, but 370 spaces identified according to program) debugging the model (never realized I have 0 talents in drawing straight lines), and finally coordinating with HSPC to assign the correct glazing to the façade. This is the first time I had the chance to work alongside project architects and can speak to them about façade design in a real-life basis (walking upstairs to constantly annoy Lauren and Stephen), the experience is very pleasant (for me lol) and I’ve learnt a lot about what architects take into concern when they’re designing the amount of glazing to put into buildings, e. g. patient privacy, views, building looks etc and it still strikes me the amount of work, knowledge and skillsets required to bring into life a decent-looking building that we take for granted daily.  Apart from significantly improving my IES-modelling skills (and getting used to the fact that the program won’t stop crashing), starting a BESS report on the building which requires to look into stormwater is equally a challenge given the limited roof size to the users density. I and Oscar (mainly Oscar) are therefore working on a water tank calculator that justifies the size of the water tank. Presentation is funny when the size of the water tank does not do much to save more water, whilst capture is limited, that might be contrary to what the authorities think and it is an art to convince them with our harvested data.  This is by far the biggest project I’ve worked on in SBE, and it is very useful to realise working on a big project refines my skillset and often requires a thorough understanding of the project in relation to BCA Section requirements because changes are less feasible. I was given the opportunity to be engaged in all the ESD design requirements in the very beginning of the project that brings about a bigger impact than joining in late when designs are almost finalized.    "

Finishing our works with SBE on Tuesday night, we attended the ASA (Architectural Science Association) conference at RMIT on behalf of SBE for 4 full days to gather useful insights on the current building trends for the company. Topics ranged from architectural philosophy to construction materials and processes, with keynote presentations from the renowned architects Jan Gehl and Gill Garner. The conference offered a plethora of built environment based researches which calls for better designs, backed by detailed case studies and building users’ feedback. We believe studying these pieces of information all together will be insightful for the industry to address building users’ needs, to improve on current design flaws and to mitigate issues specific to the built environment such as the urban heat island effect. We will be happy to share with you what we’ve learnt at the conference.  Week 2: 2 BESS test projects, IES daylight modelling During our second week at SBE, we began conducting building assessments for various commercial projects through the BESS tool. Incorporating factors such as water use, energy and daylighting, we are able to provide a building performance rating for the client. However, as one of the buildings did not pass the ‘deemed to satisfy’ (DtS) requirement for daylighting, this led us to learning and modelling the building using IES software. As the building was 5 stories with varying floors, this model took some time and effort to compose, and is going to be run over the weekend so the results can be analyzed next week. Once the results are provided, we can finally add the data back into the BESS tool and submit the assessment to the client! As well as learning BESS and IES over the last few days, Ainslie Unsworth took us to the Flagstaff Green development to shadow a weekly meeting, as well as tour the multi-story development to get an idea of what the construction sites look like in practice, a great experience! We are enjoying our time at PTA so far, it’s been great to meet everyone and thanks for helping us feel welcome! "

    "body": "2018/11/26 - SBE has been joined by two senior interns for the summer break.   Both have advanced studies under their belt and are looking to expand their experience in real projects for their time here.   ‘Introducing the new SBE Interns’ Millie (on the left): Millie is masters graduate in ‘energy efficient and sustainable buildings’ from RMIT. Originally from Brisbane, Millie moved to Melbourne to study her masters in 2015. Not being able to move past the persistently cold weather and the ongoing hay-fever, Milly has endured three years of a gruelling degree to finally end up in the pollen free, comfortable environment of SBE over this summer. A foody at heart, Millie’s other interests lie in photography, yoga and cats, her dream career being working as a photographer at a cat yoga studio. Millie was born a traveller, residing for some time in Hong Kong (from birth), Brisbane, London and now Melbourne, having visited over 35 cities. Having seen her fair share of the urban world, Millie has also been in touch with law an order in Melbourne, having visited a police station twice in one week! Don’t worry though, the crimes committed were not her own, but she learnt some tips and tricks whilst in the slammer so be nice to her at the Christmas party. Good at heart, Millie is always happy for a chat, and excited to make the most of the opportunity here at SBE. Oscar (in the middle): Oscar finished his bachelor’s in Civil Engineering from Monash. Originally from the Mornington Peninsula, Oscar is an aquaman and could dive in the ocean carrying a surfboard or maybe just sit back and relax in the hot springs with mates. Having to have a point of difference from his twin brother Tully, Oscar grew his ‘well-groomed’ beard that appears more of a bush despite efforts. Oscar lives in the city and rides a bike to SBE so do give him some space in the shower room as it might be a bit sweaty. In any case we miss a musician at the Xmas party, Oscar could recite the full sonata of Mozart but that might be the only piece he’s ready for. If he’s having hard day, you’ll likely find him finishing off a family sized Margarita pizza all by himself. Oscar went to Woodleigh School, and is a little jealous that he never properly enjoyed the homesteads since they’ve been renovated. Oscar is currently learning German and not afraid to point out the right German beers confidently naming them to the bar tender though it might be tricky if he’s German. Looking as fresh as he seems, Oscar is keen to get to know everyone and is excited for his stay in SBE. Elio the Geek (on the right) Not so young, he remembers when Tron the movie first came out, at the drive in. "

    "img": "/uploads/NCC2019SectionJ1.5-Graph1.jpg",
    "body": "2018/10/17 - With the release of the NCC 2019 approaching (expected for May 2019) we have taken some time to familiarise ourselves with the proposed changes to Section J. In particular, we focused on the Deemed-to-Satisfy (DTS) Section J1. 5 Wall-Glazing Construction which proposes a new approach in which wall and glazing performance is calculated as a system value and different orientations and levels can be assessed together. Before we start it is worthwhile pointing out that with the amount of glazing in typical commercial buildings (the industry currently seems to like between 60%-80% WWR) being the big issue from a thermal performance point of view, achieving compliance following a DTS approach has always proved challenging. As such, compliance following the DTS pathway is generally limited to small developments with a WWR of less than 40%-50% and with appropriately designed external shading. 2016 vs 2019: Nonetheless, for argument and comparison sake, let’s have a look at what glazing system a hypothetical single-storey office building in climate zone 6, with a 70% WWR and no outdoor shading would need to specify in order to achieve compliance under either the NCC 2016 or 2019 DTS pathways. As shown by the graph below, following the NCC 2016 DTS approach results in varying system U-Values based on facade orientation. On the other hand the NCC 2019 DTS approach offers a more streamlined result with a consistent system U-value of 2. 43. Here it is important to note that such consistency in U-Values is only achieved if the external walls in each orientation have the same U-Value. As we shall see later on, if the U-Value of the walls changes, then the resultant U-Value of the glazing is also likely to change.  Similarly to what we have seen for the U-Value, the system SHGC varies across orientations when using the NCC2016 DTS approach, but remains constant at 0. 19 across all facades when using the 2019 DTS approach. Again, this is only the case if the same WWR and shading multiplier are applied across the various facades.  These results indicate that for typical commercial buildings both the NCC2016 and NCC2019 require arguably unrealistic performances in the current Australian market, where standard aluminium frames and clear glazing remains the most popular choice. However, it could be said that at the very least the 2019 approach seems to provide a more flexible approach to the ‘strictness’ characteristic of a prescriptive approach. This is especially the case once orientation-specific design responses are implemented. Trading performance requirements: Again just for argument sake, let’s assume that our case study building achieve a Total R-Value for external walls 10% better than current requirements for class 5 buildings in climate zone 6 (i. e. RT3. 08) and that a 300mm shading projection is included just above the windows on the north, east and west orientations. In this instance we can see that while the NCC2016 will still mandate fairly low and arguably unrealistic U-Values, the NCC2019 approach by taking into account the increased performance of the walls will require a U-Value of 3. 28. While this can still be considered as a relatively performing window system it could be achieved by a standard aluminium frame.  In relation to the SHGC that would be required after the inclusion of external shading the performance remain relatively high regardless of the NCC version used. However, the NCC 2019 seems to provide a more streamlined solution across facades.  To Conclude: From this brief analysis we can conclude that the NCC 2019 provides a slightly more flexible approach for assessing external walls and glazing performance following the DTS pathway. However, the DTS requirements remain fairly strict and it would be unlikely that a typical commercial building would be able to achieve compliance following this method, unless the facades are optimised to suits the environmental conditions of their orientations and highly performing window systems are specified. An alternative verification method, such as the JV3 or from 2019 a NABERS or Green Star rating, will likely remain the most appropriate pathway to demonstrate compliance for most commercial buildings. Finally, it goes without saying that we welcome the changes to the NCC 2019 in relation to Section J as these should bring Australian building regulations back in line with other developed countries and will also play an important contribution in the effort to reduce our national greenhouse gas emissions and support the development of industries that gravitates around energy efficiency.

    "body": "2018/07/09 - Between May and June 2018, SBE, in collaboration with Ironbark Sustainability, completed Type 2 Energy Audits at five local government’s facilities including two office buildings, one aquatic and leisure centres, one operational depot centre, and one mixed-use facility incorporating library, art gallery, performing art and office spaces. Energy audits, as detailed investigation of the energy flows within a building should be considered a crucial and regular milestones  of a building life cycle aimed at understanding where energy come from, how it is used and how it could be optimised overtime. While greater opportunities to increase performance may be found in ‘old’ buildings designed and constructed before Section J of the NCC was introduced, due to the fast uptake of technological improvements regular assessments can be of benefits to building of all ages and types. These audits identified a variety of improvements including:  Replacing fluorescent, halogen, mercury vapour, and high pressure sodium lighting with LED technology.  Installing appropriate lighting controls such as daylight and motion sensors.  Replacing electric storage domestic hot water units with either electric continuous flow or heat pumps.  Installing timer on boiling and chilled water taps.  Retrofitting wall insulation to brick veneer or double brick buildings.  Installing solar photovoltaic arrays. If implemented in combination, these improvements would cost approximately $340,000 and would result in a 28% reduction in yearly greenhouse gas emissions, 24% reduction in yearly energy costs and have an average payback period of less than 6 years.

The Judges have determined that a Certificate of Merit be awarded to you, in recognition of your efforts.   During their deliberations, the Judges made the following observations about your submission, which we share with you to assist you further develop your skills:  The submission has design merit, and has been well considered, with visual interest.  The master bedroom seems disproportionate to the bed as shown, and the WIR underwhelming.  The main passage is 1. 5m wide suggesting accessibility is partially considered but it doesn’t continue through with other integration. It may have needed a little more work on the flow of the building.  A little more could have been be done on the presentation side of the documents, with improved indoor/outdoor connection.  In reviewing the frate file, no allowance for an R-value of earth has been assumed to the roof. The R2. 3 is to the rear metal portion - 100mm blanket under roof sheets.  Therefore it could further be argued that the earth berm could be metal deck meaning handrail is not needed – changes the appearance and design, but arguable.  A couple of small errors in the assessment, but without a change in outcome.  A slight reduction to 9. 9 stars if we consider the plans show timber flooring, but tiles was used. Nonetheless, a well-considered submission, and worthy of a Certificate of Merit. We appreciate the time and effort your collaboration put into this submission, and wish you every success as you all progress your career.

While interning at SBE I have learnt so much in a very supportive work environment and had so many good experiences. Rob and Sean were very helpful mentors and have expanded my knowledge and skills about environmental design. &nbsp; Working in this multidisciplinary team with Poornima and Mark has also been very beneficial for my interpersonal skills in a cooperate environment. The opportunities offered were very advantageous for my understanding of the Architectural industry. I was given the privilege of sitting in on meetings, going on site visits, working with other designers and having our design for the design competition we entered reviewed by practicing architects. As this week has been wrapping up we&rsquo;ve spent time doing leaving reviews, getting shown projects that SBE is working on in IES and are still having a play with the Ladybug and Honeybee in Rhino. This internship has solidified my thinking that in my architectural career I want to focus on passive and/or regenerative design. 																								&nbsp;																																																																																							Thank you, SBE!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  																														Poornima reporting:																																							Time flies and we are finishing our internship. This summer has been so productive, and I am grateful to SBE for providing me with the opportunity to do this internship. Apart from the technical training, I also got a chance to attend client meetings, have site visit, doing research and attending seminar. Everything helped me in broadening my horizons and clearing my perspective about my future goals. I have learnt a lot, gained technical and industry knowledge and built on my interpersonal skills. Being an International student and new to this field, it was an amazing (and much needed) experience to work and learn from industry experts. I also got to make great friends, Leah and Mark who have been wonderful to work with. We learnt a lot from each other&rsquo;s experiences while working as a team and during brain-storming sessions. My university starts from next week, but this time I&rsquo;ll be back with better skills and confidence, thank you SBE!!&nbsp;&nbsp;																		  																																			Mark reporting:																								Time is going very fast and this is last day for my internship. I am very happy that I did this internship during the summer. During the internship, I have learnt many software such as Firstrate5, Bess, IES VE and I got a better understanding of working in the office. The company working environment is totally different from school, but I still enjoyed working here. I didn&rsquo;t have much knowledge about the architecture and design. Leah and Poornima were great colleagues because they really helped and explained a lot about design issues. Also, we have done the 10-star rating competition perfectly and hopefully we can get a great result for the competition. Moreover, I want to say thanks to our supervisors Roberto and Sean because they always give us the positive attitude and encourage us for all the projects. In conclusion, I am very happy with the whole internship and I will keep learning different skills for my future career. 																								&nbsp;																												 																																																																																"

    "body": "2018/02/15 - A quick update about what we have been up to… Poornima reporting:  This week we were a bit relaxed after submitting our design for the competition. We were given different topics related to passive cooling techniques, to prepare a research paper on. I researched about night-sky cooling. Also, we presented our papers next day, as to have a better understanding about them. It was interesting to learn about the ways buildings can be cooled naturally, with minimum active components. A new software IES-Virtual Environment (VE) was introduced to us, which is a suite of building performance and applications. It is used to test building performance, identify passive solutions, draw conclusions on energy use and occupant comfort. Today, we started learning about ladybug and honeybee on grasshopper on Rhino, which are commercial 3D graphics and computer aided design application software. We will continue learning them next week also. Learning all these tools, would benefit me with my university curriculum as well as career wise.  Leah reporting:  The deadline of the design competition was Monday 4pm, and we submitted our design at 3. 57pm. It was stress inducing but we&rsquo;re all so glad to have successfully submitted our first design competition! Moving on, this week we designed an office building and have been learning how to use IES (Integrated Environmental Solutions) software to analysis the buildings&rsquo; performance thresholds such as: thermal properties and daylight factor. Learning how to use IES has been complicated, as it seems to be a program where you need to follow its rules exactly, but the analysing power it has is incredible! We&rsquo;ve also completed a research paper on a passive thermal regulation system and presented it as if we were convincing a client to install it during a meeting. Mine focused on Thermal Labyrinths, which are the most common de-coupled or ground-coupled thermal mass regulation systems. Today we&rsquo;ve just started looking into the Honeybee and Ladybug plugins for Grasshopper on Rhino. Learning these ESD programs has been very educational and mind opening because most Architecture students wouldn&rsquo;t get the opportunity.     Mark reporting:  Last week, we finally finished the design competition and submitted it on time. Then, each of us researched a different passive cooling system, and presented it in a meeting environment. This week, we learnt a new simulation software called Integrated Environmental Solutions (IES). IES is a very useful software in sustainable modelling and energy analysis. IES is often used by green building consultants and architects to evaluate the energy for buildings. I had trouble to use IES because this software has many icons and the different steps are hard to remember. I took notes and wrote some steps on my notebook for memorizing. Next week is the last week for our internship. we will learn some more skills on IES. We hope that we will have a better understanding of IES before the internship finishes.  "

This week, we have been working intensively on our design and finalising it. We achieved 10 stars on FirstRate and then started working on the design layout, to make it visually interesting. Different design layouts were made, and we brainstormed on the passive design features that can be implemented in our design to make it most sustainable, energy efficient and pocket friendly. We emphasised on use of solar panels, rain water harvesting and its filtration, use of recycled material for construction, urban gardening and green roof. Also, the house rating was tested in all different climatic zones of Australia, and it never got a rating below 7. 4, making it suitable for all locations (and minor changes lead to higher rating everywhere). Thanks to Sean and Rob for their valuable ideas and help, without which we would have not been able to complete our design. Hoping to do well at the competition and impressing the judges with our design. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Leah Report: &nbsp;This week for me has mainly consisted of rendering our design using Lumion Pro 8 and Photoshop. Lumion is a rendering program that I haven&rsquo;t used before, but thanks to a little (read: a lot) of instruction from the other young architects at the firm I managed to produce some decent results. Now we&rsquo;re just laying out the drawings, renders and research we have done over the past 6 weeks to submit on Monday by 4pm. Mark:Time is going very fast and this is our final week to work on the design competition. All of us were 100% focus on the design competition this week. Each of us were doing different sections for our design competition. For the whole week, I was concentrating on researching earth berm and solar system for the house. Basically, the earth berm house has many advantages such as strong structural strength and saving many spaces. Based on the research, there are more and more sustainable house used an earth berm structure in the world. Also, I decided to use a 5kW solar system for this sustainable house because it can generate more energy. There is also a storing battery which can store the energy during the day and use it at night when the solar panels are not working. Poornima was trying to achieve 10-star rating on Firstrate5 and writing the specification for elements. Leah was mainly completing the design of the house and generating the 3D images for this sustainable house. By the end of this week, we have almost finished the design competition. On the weekend, we will work home to make sure the whole design finished and submit it before the due date. &nbsp;&nbsp;"

    "body": "2018/01/29 - Hello everyone! Mark reporting: This week, we worked on the DTS. Rob taught us how to understand and find the information from different architectural drawings. Basically, the uncompleted DTS report includes three parts from J1 to J3. J1 is about the Building Fabric, J2 is about Glazing and J3 is about Building Sealing. Each of us had our own part to do and my part was J1. I need to read both National Construction Code Series and architectural drawings to complete the DTS report. I found it hard to understand the architectural drawings. Rob taught me the procedure of finding the information from the architectural drawings and helped me to finish the Building Fabric part. After that, I have reviewed the method that he showed me and tried to do it again. Today, we will try to finish the 10-star rating on Firstrate5 for our design competition. Next week, we will concentrate on the design competition and make sure we can submit next week. Leah Reporting: This week was different for myself as I had the opportunity to attend meetings with some of Peddle Thorp’s experienced architects. These meetings were eye opening into the negotiation and politics’ side of architecture that often dictate the design outcomes. As one of Peddle Thorps design director Peter Brook explained to me on the way to the first meeting at the Moonee Valley Council Centre ‘Architecture is a performing art’ - the hardest part is actually convincing people to like the design. The council meeting was very enlightening for my learning as Peter pitched a large aquatic centre design to the council and consequentially I now feel like I’ve had a crash course in aquatic design. The second meeting was run by Paul who is designing with a team, a 200-dwelling master plan for a new development on an ex-quarry site at Ferntree Gully. Besides these meetings; as a team we have been reading through Section J of the NCC and learning to fill out and DTS report including learning to use a glazing calculator. The dead line of the design competition is looming, time to do some extra hard work! Poornima reporting: Week 5 of internship and we are half way through it. This week we were briefed on DTS, National construction code provisions to demonstrate compliance with energy efficiency performance requirements and we were given to prepare a professional report. Also, I had the opportunity to attend two meetings of new projects under Peddle Thorp. One was of a residential project and another being of a government building. It was very interesting to see how the architects and various stakeholders discuss different design options, their pros and cons and come to an agreement. Parallelly, we have been working on our house design for the competition, imparting the recommendations from the senior architects and have got 9. 4 rating. Hope to complete it before deadline. "

This site has been built for 4 years already and it will take another 6 years to finish the construction. This building is an apartment complex with a retail space at the ground level. The project architect Neil, took us into the site and showed us around in different levels. The architect described the structure of this building site and materials used. Also, he showed us the different types of windows constructed and the function of fire water tank. It was very interesting for me because this is my first time visiting a building site. On Wednesday, we had a meeting with three architects to discuss our sustainable house design. They gave us feedback on our design and helped us troubleshoot our questions. After the meeting, we changed our design based on their advice. We are still researching the best materials to use and truss structure for the earth berm. Today, we will keep changing our design and I&rsquo;ll try to finish the BESS report. Leah reporting -The deadline for the design competition is getting nearer and with three weeks to go we are going to make some major design changes. &nbsp; We had a meeting with three Peddle Thorp Architects: Stephen, Jessie, and Riya, who kindly and sharply critiqued every aspect of our design. Having an architectural design discussion with these experienced architects was extremely helpful in finessing the program of the building as well as putting us on the right track with materiality and how the structure will support loads from the green roof. &nbsp; We have decided to have thick in-situ concrete walls to retain the earth berm and transfer it&rsquo;s loads into the ground, but a lighter weight coated steel truss system to support the green roof. This week we also went on a site visit to 24 Hopkins St Footscray that is currently under construction. I was super excited to see inside as it&rsquo;s a building site that I have been driving past multiple times a week since the start of its construction roughly 4 years ago. Neil, the project architect, walked us through the design along with some of his project builders and answered all our enthusiastic questions. The building is backed by developers from China and is a mixed-use apartment block. &nbsp; It was super interesting seeing parts of the structure half-finished as it solidified my understanding about things that I had seen before only in drawings or as finished products. Poornima reporting: -Second week of 2018 and we are still energised and motivated (more due to the 10-star rating we achieved for our house design). Some changes in the windows and doors structure and altering the insulation, lead us to achieve a full 10-stars in FirstRate. Also, we had a meeting with three architects from Peddle Thorp &ndash; Stephen, Jessie and Riya, to critique our house design. We showcased our house design, explaining about the competition and intricate details about it. They recommended few changes like changing the structure of the earth berm to make is strong enough to be held by the walls, moving the location of the bedrooms to increase privacy, making the shipping container wider to make the master bedroom the largest, to name a few. They answered our queries related to the passive design and construction material and also, told us about the common architectural practices in Australia that can be implemented by us. We also had an opportunity to go on a site visit in Footscray. The site was a Peddle Thorp project of an apartment building, with shopping complex in lower floors and was shown to us by Neil. It was interesting to see how the actual work is done on sites and the way multiple problems are handled simultaneously. Rest, we are still working on our house design, implementing the changes recommended by architects and will be back next week with our final work!!  SBE interns house design critique  "

    "body": "2018/01/11 - Hello everyone!!We are back after vacations, energised and excited. Here&rsquo;s this week&rsquo;s progress.    Mark reporting:  This week, we concentrated on the BDAV 10 stars design competition. The highest rating on firstrate5 is 9. 2 stars so far. We hope the rating can be 10 stars at the end of next week. Also, I have learnt a new software called BESS. BESS is a software used for analysing the sustainability of building projects. It is also good to use in future studies. Basically, this week each of us focused on different tasks assigned to us. I have been mainly doing ratings for town planning on firstrate5 and preparing the BESS report, and got more than 6 stars for all the dwellings in the town house complex. Therefore, the cooling and heating data can be used to generate a BESS report. The BESS report is due today, so that we can focus on design competition next week.   &nbsp;    Leah reporting:  This week has been busy, heavily focused on the design competition as well as learning how to use BESS to create an ESD report in the town planning stage of design. &nbsp; Our Design has changed dramatically! The break over the holidays gave us fresh eyes and time to do more research. Firstly, our design has dropped to a single story from a double story because it was a lot simpler to achieve a high rating with only one level. Secondly, instead of designing for inner city Melbourne we have decided to go rural and the postcode of our design is now 2280, Broken Hill, NSW. This decision was made to give us more freedom in testing new innovative, sustainability ideas, which would be difficult in the inner city. We have been playing a lot with heavy thermal mass in our design and Broken Hill&rsquo;s climate is a perfect candidate for this. We have also scaled back the size of the indoor space of our dwelling to 141 square meters, which is well below the current Australia average of 227 square meters. We have been carefully thinking about our window placement and are reducing the openings of our dwellings to reduce heat loss in winter and reduce heat gain in summer. Currently we are testing a design that has a partial artificially built Earth Berm that extends over part of our roof to stabilise the indoor temperature. Also, a part of the design is an upcycled shipping container for the master bedroom suite, which increases the recycled material used for construction, hence decreasing waste.   &nbsp;    Poornima reporting:  We started with a fresh mind and more creative ideas (thanks to the break) for our design competition, taking the rating of our house design from 7. 8 to 9. 2. We learnt a lot more about passive designing techniques along with FirstRate5, which helped in achieving higher ratings. We are still working on its design and enhancing its other features, to make it the best performing sustainable design. Also, a new software, BESS (for town planning) was introduced to us. It is Built Environment Sustainability Scorecard, which assesses the sustainability performance of a building or alteration based on various parameters like IEQ, energy and water efficiency. After doing the assessment, we were given to make a professional report on it. That&rsquo;s it for now, we&rsquo;ll be back next week with our improved designs and other learnings!! PS - Note none of the above projects are for external clients, they are internal exercises only.  Shipping container on the left, green roof in the middle and an earth berm on the right. "

    "body": "2017/12/21 - Designing a house?&nbsp; Less is more!Mark reporting: Firstly, this week we learned about and analysed different technical drawings for buildings such as architectural, mechanical and hydraulic. I got a better understanding after doing some exercises where we searched through the drawings for small details Sean asked us to find. Then, we started to think about the design competition that is due in February. The competition is to design a 10-star sustainable house that satisfies all the requirements of sustainable design. After brainstorming, we decided to design a single dwelling, 3 bedroom, two-story house. The software we used to design is called SketchUp, and then we used FirstRate5 to rate the two floors to see efficiency of our design. Since then we have been playing with the design to see how efficient we can make it . The highest green star rating we have achieved is 7. 8 out of 10 so far. It is a good result, well above the standard for an Australian house, but still a bit of far from our goal. In the following weeks, we will keep changing the design and rate it until the best design outcome is achieved. &nbsp;&nbsp;Leah reporting: The design competition has been the main focus of this week and I am super excited about it. To me, it feels like every bit of research and design studio at University has led up to this competition, as it&rsquo;s an opportunity to push our thinking about passive design. I just have to remind myself that we are designing a rather conventional family house in Melbourne that is within a realistic budget, that needs to stand up, is up to code, and something people actually want to live in. So it probably cannot be built using mud, straw, recycled glass bottles, the most expensive PV cells money can buy and wishful thinking. &nbsp; As a team, we have chosen to design a single 3-bed dwelling, because we were daunted about designing a multi-residential project, but Sean casually mentioned that designing a single dwelling to be compliant with 10 green stars is actually more difficult, but we&rsquo;ve decided to stick with it. We already have a basic sketch design using SketchUp and SketchUp Layout and are now testing it. Besides this, we have done other &lsquo;normal intern things. &rsquo; We attended a lecture at Melbourne University by Prof Heidi Sinning about Cooperative Housing in Zurich that I found super interesting but I think the others may have dozed off. So, I&rsquo;m not sure whether I like boring things or whether they&rsquo;re just not as excited as me about the idea of a shared economy in Gesellschaft or how 20 people can live in one mass apartment without conflict. This week we have also been reading a lot of plan drawings, waiting to see if there is going to be another fire drill, and taking each other out on lunch dates to get to know each other. &nbsp;Poornima reporting: Hello everyone!! I am back again with my just started internship progress. This week, we had an opportunity to attend a seminar by Prof Heidi Sinning. It was about how we can implement sustainable, affordable and socially-mixed housing, followed by some co-operative housing models in Zurich. It was very interesting to know about the positive impacts that co-operative housing can have on the environment as well as the society. In the middle of the week, we were given some structural, architectural and mechanical drawings to read and enhance our plan reading skills and understanding. Also, we had a detailed session on the design competition. It&rsquo;s all about designing a 10-star NatHERS rated house, which is energy efficient and includes passive design features. We have been trying different designs and patterns that help us achieve the best rating that is cost effective as well. Till date, we have achieved a rating of 7. 8 stars. Everyone being from diverse backgrounds has different ideas, it&rsquo;s been a fun-filled experience with collaborative learning and growth. Stay tuned to know more about our project design and wishing you all Merry Christmas. (We are now off to our Christmas celebrations at Taxi Kitchen, see you in the new year) &nbsp;"

The Interns will focus on learning new software, environmental sustainable building techniques and collaborative learning. The interns will be given the opportunity to enter the BDAV 10-star sustainable design challenge 2018, working together as a team, pooling their diverse background knowledge to develop a zero-net energy dwelling. &nbsp;Learn more about Mark, Leah and Poornima as they introduce themselves:This is Mark and I come from China. I am currently studying Mechanical Engineering at RMIT University. My hobbies are singing and playing basketball. I am happy to do this internship at SBE because I am interested in buildings and environments. &nbsp;I think this will be a good opportunity to learn new skills and software in a working environment. We are currently learning some software called Firstrate5. &nbsp;Firstrate5 enables a designer to generate energy and heating and cooling predictions for houses and to rate the. I look forward to learning a lot more in the weeks to come. Hi, I&rsquo;m Leah and I&rsquo;m half way through a Masters of Architecture at The University of Melbourne. Over the past 4 years of study I have become very interested in sustainable and passive design that pushes the boundaries of current construction knowledge and how people interact/connect with their dwellings. I am a first-generation Melbournian, my heritage being South-Eastern European, and I am very proud to be living in this dynamic city. Melbourne is the world&rsquo;s most liveable city; therefore, I feel designers in Melbourne should be actively trying to create dwellings that benefit our urban fabric and push environmental innovation. A moment that changed my perspective on sustainability and I feel has directed my career projection was an introduction lecture by Dr Helena Bender in my first year at Melbourne University studying a Bachelor of Environments. &nbsp; She compared the way architects speak of sustainability to how others speak of their marriage. We define a successful marriage as &lsquo;fantastic&rsquo; or &lsquo;amazing,&rsquo; if we define a marriage as &lsquo;sustainable,&rsquo; it isn&rsquo;t good enough. Then why are we happy as architects when a building is considered &lsquo;sustainable,&rsquo; a building should be &lsquo;more than sustainable. &rsquo; When I am not behind a computer I enjoy spending time hiking, sipping coffee, patting other people&rsquo;s dogs, doing yoga or competing in the sport of fencing. &nbsp;Hi, I&rsquo;m Poornima, from India. I did Engineering in Electronics and Communication in my undergrad from India and then worked as a System Engineer for around 2. 5 years. Currently I&rsquo;m pursuing Masters of Environment from University of Melbourne and just started my internship with SBE. I am specialising in Energy efficiency modelling and implementation stream, which builds on my previous work as an engineer. I was drawn to working at SBE as am particularly interested in sustainable buildings, design, energy efficiency and renewable energy sector and SBE&rsquo;s internship program aligns perfectly with my career goals. I am passionate about the environment as much as I am interested in painting and cooking. I am so excited to develop and learn new skills during this internship. In the first week of internship, we were presented with the organisational structure, its working and different projects it handles. Also, we have been learning FirstRate, a mandatory tool for NatHERS rating. It helps us in building skills on assessing thermal performance of buildings. At the end of the week, we were briefed on the design competition, its rules and what is expected out of us. &nbsp; Stay posted on this blog for our progress!!"

    "body": "2017/11/10 - Clause 58 (Apartments Developments) has now been in the Planning Scheme of Victorian councils for a few months and SBE, apart from assisting the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning and the Office of the Victorian Government Architect to develop guidelines for alternative daylight assessment pathways, has also already worked on a number of projects required to comply with this clause and its sub-clauses. Of particular interest to our work is the requirement of sub-clause 58. 03-1 Energy Efficiency Objectives, which requires dwellings located in certain NatHERS climate zones to not exceed specified annual cooling loads (see image below).  In order to meet these maximum allowed cooling loads we have seen developments specifying glazing solutions with fairly low Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC) values. As a consequence, not only construction cost increased but these developments also suffered from lower NatHERS ratings due to a diminished passive heating potential. To provide some context and background we should remember that when it comes to residential buildings, Melbourne and most of the State of Victoria, is considered a ‘heating dominated’ climate. This means that for most of the year it is assumed that residential dwellings operate heating systems to maintain comfort conditions. This assumption is reflected within the NatHERS software which usually ‘favours’ designs that maximise solar heat gains as a passive heating strategy. At the same time, it is also important to remember that as discussed by ex SBE staff Chris Jensen, overheating is becoming an issue for a number of apartment buildings, and as such it is important to provide appropriate measures to limit solar heat gains. Maintaining the cooling loads of residential apartments within the specified limits while ensuring that the overall rating is not negatively compromised, is thus a balancing act that can be achieved following two general approaches: by design or by specifying higher levels of insulation and glazing performance. If we take the design approach, a collaborative design process between the architect and the ESD consultant during the early phases of the project would be necessary to optimise the building in terms of form, orientation, internal layout, wall-to-window ratio, and external shading. On the other hand, if we take the over-specify approach, the ESD consultant can pick up a fairly resolved design and specify whatever level of insulation and glazing performance is needed to achieve the various town planning and building permit statutory requirements. While both approaches may lead to a compliant solution, the implications to the project can be drastically different. By designing a building with consideration for statutory requirements from the early stages can result in additional consultant fees during the (early) design process. However, if the insulation and glazing has to be over-specified to compensate for ‘poor’ design, this can results in significantly higher construction cost and life-cycle energy.   "

    "body": "2017/10/31 - Directly adjacent to a train station and close to trams and numerous amenities this site offers the residents the opportunity to live with a reduced carbon footprint.  A resident choosing to live in the building may not need to use a car in their day to day life, will not need air conditioning to be comfortable, will not need to purchase and run their own inefficient domestic laundry appliances, will be able to grow some of their own food requirements and will be able to dispose of a large portion of their compostable waste. The building has made the most of the site and its limited northern exposure. Deep balconies on the north and limited glazing to the east and west will help deal with unwanted sun and glare. Voids have been introduced to promote better daylight penetration and ventilation. The set-back on the building on the west at ground floor permits greater climate control opportunities for the west facing ground floor tenancies and two further indents on the west side of the plan create useful outdoor green spaces. The use of sprinklers will permit greater flexibility for cross flow ventilation across and between the floor plates. The central location and open nature of the stairwell will encourage residents to use them instead of the lift. The fully trafficable roof is an excellent social initiative permitting the residents access to daylighting, views, fresh air, gardens and other recreational spaces, central laundry and clothes drying lines and compostable waste receptacles. Last but by no means least it is hoped the combination of central open stair, shared roof top amenities, the focus on bicycles and other ‘cooperative’ operational initiatives enshrined in the Body Corporate will help to foster positive interactions between the residents of this building. It is refreshing to see the client adopting more than just engineering solutions to today’s environmental and social challenges. The elimination of carparking and provision of extensive bicycle support facilities is an admirable initiative. People who choose to live in this development will do so without a car. The allocation of a ‘share-car’ parking bay outside the building will provide for residents who may occasionally need a car. The building has been constructed of components with high thermal and acoustic performance and this will contribute to their lower energy demands. An average of 8 stars has been achieved for apartment ratings. Finishes are  raw and exposed wherever possible to reduce the embodied energy of the building. At the same time the use of solid concrete structure and cladding will ensure the building has a long life. Sweep fans will be provided throughout.  Heating will be provided with low energy hydronic radiant heating panels.

The project consisted of the demolition of existing buildings fronting Harvest Road and Turton Street to make way for a two storey and three storey development comprising of 109 beds and has a maximum staffing allowance of 43 staff at any one time. The buildings have a total Gross Floor Area of 6,521m2. This project was awarded a 4 star rating under the Green Star Healthcare Design v1 tool in 2016, which equates to Australian Best Practice. Air-conditioning systems are a VRV (Variable Refrigerant Volume) system. The VRV system generally comprises centralised air cooled outdoor units with multiple indoor Fan Coil Units (FCU’s). All Fan Coil Units are capable of independent heating and cooling. The VRV systems will generally be heat recovery type to allow for simultaneous heating and cooling to occur between separate FCU’s, thereby reducing the system energy requirements. The indoor units are zoned to match the space thermal loads and room operational characteristics.    Separate systems are provided for Common Areas and Bedrooms Areas. The system COP for the VRV systems was based on the Mitsubishi Hi-COP R2 VRV system of 4. 41 for cooling, and 4. 49 for heating. Fresh air is ducted to the back of fan coil units throughout the building via a centralised ducted system. Fresh air isprecooled/heated by Heat recovery units located at roof level. The heat recovery units will utilise the toilet exhaust to provide a degree of precooling/heating and DX coils shall operate as require maintaining a constant air off temperature. These units shall operate 24/7 to maintain constant building ventilation.

Dedicated, natural gas fired, low temperature, hot water boiler and associated pumps to provide heating to the office areas. Pressure independent VAV systems serving the office levels with separate units provided for internal and perimeter zones. All VAV systems incorporate outside air economy cycles. Supply air on office floors is generally via sheet metal ductwork and flexible ductwork to high induction swirl type diffusers. The amount of water used in the building has been reduced by using efficient fittings: 6/3L dual flush toilets; 2L/min urinals with an auto flush; 4L/min basin taps; and 9L/min shower heads. 60kL of rainwater storage capacity has been provided in tanks on Level 1. All rainwater run-off from the building footprint (1280m2) is directed to the tank for reuse in the toilets. The estimated demand for water for reuse in the toilets is 163kL/month, based on twice daily usage of the 6/3L dual flush toilets.   The projected potable water consumption is 7. 81L/person/day. "

The graph below demonstrates the effect of the labyrinth when 1,800 L/s of outside air are drawn through three 30m long concrete pipes during a warm summer day. Based on our modelling the building produces 50% to 64% less greenhouse gases than the Green Star conditional benchmark established for the project. The improved building fabric, together with the intake of fresh air through the labyrinth when beneficial, keeps the temperatures within the comfort band throughout most of the year. Peak temperatures are also significantly reduced with the building topping out at 36°C on a 46°C day (simulated). "

Building V - Mawson Institute was the first laboratory intensive building to achieve a 5 Star Green Star rating in South Australia in 2011. In 2010 Building V at Mawson Lakes Campus was also awarded the top prize for sustainable architecture at the Australian Institute of Architect’s South Australian State Architecture Awards. Designed by Guida Moseley Brown Architects in association with Russell &amp; Yelland Architects, Building V expresses both the fundamental principles of environmentally sustainable design and the innovative research of the Mawson Institute’s advanced manufacturing research groups. The design of Building V is centred around promoting interaction between each of the Mawson Institute’s advanced engineering research groups to encourage innovative and leading edge research that can move beyond the University and into pre-commercialisation. The air conditioning system serving Building V comprises of a central thermal plant (chillers and boilers) located in the Power House and serving the entire Mawson Lakes Campus.   The Power House contains 3 chillers and 2 boilers, which reticulates chilled and heated water to the air handling units located throughout the campus including Building V. Building V is also served by one air-cooled chiller, which provides stand-by chilled water capacity to the clean rooms only in the event of a primary chilled water system failure. Building V contains chilled water and heated water pumps which reticulate chilled/heated water from the ring main to all the air handling units located around the building. The air handling units then deliver primary air into each air-conditioned zone. Each zone is provided with a minimum outside air volumetric flow rate which is at least a 100% improvement on the minimum outside air flow rates specified by AS1668-1991. The building form and orientation represents best practice environmental sustainability through demonstrating best practice passive solar design. The distinctive building form, including the green wall and services corridor represent innovative responses to the need for a flexible, highly specialised collaborative research environment. This innovation reflects the ideals and motivations that the building users will be pursuing in their own research. "

A roof terrace area can be accessed from the first floor.   The total floor area is 10,230m2. The HVAC system consists of a central heating hot water and chilled water plant to supply heating and cooling to water coils located within the roof-mounted air handling units. Gas fired condensing boilers with one large 480kW boiler and four smaller Bosch GB162 100 kW wall mounted cascade boilers were specified. Each boiler has an efficiency of 93%. Two York Air Cooled Screw Chillers each with a 600kW capacity were specified. The air handling and distribution system was proposed to utilise the Bauer Optimisation System (BAOPT) with five air handling units serving the building. Two units serve the office areas with dedicated individual air handling units to be provided to serve the training rooms, cafeteria and kitchen area.   The Bauer system is a product owned Bosch, hence its adoption for this building. Each zone will be provided with branch ducts connected to 1/3 and 2/3 supply ducts with control provided by motorized dampers. This will provide continuous outside air ventilation to the building even when heating and cooling is not required. Outside air economy cycles are capable of providing up to 100% outside air. VSD allowances have been made on the 1/3 and 2/3 supply duct air fans and the return air fans based on the heating and cooling load profiles of the building. Heat recovery is used to pre-heat/pre-cool the outside air through air-to-air heat exchange with the return air. Thermal heat recovery wheels have been proposed on the minimum outside air at 75% efficiency. Daylight dimming controls are predicted to deliver 13% energy by linearly reducing the artificial lighting demands from 100% to 50% proportionate to the daylight availability.  This energy reduction translates into annual savings of ~$6,300 based on an electricity rate of $0. 28/kWh. The building was also designed to be very airtight. The building was ‘blower door tested’ before handover and a permeability of 2. 352 m3/hr·m2 was achieved, which was the lowest (best) result achieved on a large commercial building that ‘Efficiency Matrix’ the testers had yet seen in Australia.

The configuration of the building footprint, wrapping around an internal courtyard and adopting a narrow floor plate, creates a high quality internal environment by accessing natural light, fresh air, and views to the outdoor environment, allowing for a strong personal connection to the external environment for both Staff and students. The building makes use of external shading, double glazing and high performance glass as well as internal blinds to minimise direct solar gain while still providing good levels of natural daylight. A 33kW photovoltaic array will be installed on the building roof. It will produce electricity that will be feed directly to the building’s main distribution board. It is expected that the photovoltaic array will produce 43,800kWh of electricity each year. At times when the building electricity demand is less than the amount being supplied by the PV system, the excess electricity will be fed back to the substation for use in nearby buildings, thereby directly reducing the greenhouse gas emissions of other adjacent buildings. The building air conditioning system is based on the central energy plant of the site. Chilled water and heating hot water, extended from the central plant, provide heating and cooling to a secondary chilled water and heating hot water loop. In turn, the secondary loops provide cooling and heating to zoned fan coil units providing fresh air with pre-tempering to the heat recovery units. 4-pipe active chilled beams are fitted and zoned to individual rooms with air flows designed to match the room loads. The HVAC design also incorporates natural ventilation capabilities. All active chilled beams (ACBs) are fitted with switching panels enabling zone switching when natural ventilation conditions are satisfied. Zones are fitted with LED indicators for indication to occupants when it is suitable to open the windows. Chilled beams have been used at ANU Fenner School to provide heating and cooling using water to transport heat. The space is cooled through radiant and convective exchange where heat is exchanged between surfaces of differing temperatures, and cool air descends freely from the beams instead of being blown into the spaces by fans. Ceiling surfaces are normally in the range of 15-18°C which provides a much more pleasant radiant cooling effect for occupants. Outdoor air is provided via a ducted heat recovery ventilator air system consisting of intake louvres (at the façade of the building), constant volume fans, pre-tempering cooling and heating coils and ductwork reticulating down the corridor. Branch outdoor air ducts are provided for each room connected directly to the chilled beams. The minimum air quantity will be based on a 150% improvement in AS1668. 2 minimum requirements to meet the Green Star Requirements. Motion sensors and daylight dimming will be used to reduce energy consumption from lighting. Energy used for lighting is further reduced by providing manually controlled task lighting to each desk thus allowing a lower level of luminance required from the main lights in the building.   The base building lighting also uses a DALI lighting control system.

    "body": "2017/10/30 - Harnessing and improving access to daylighting in apartment buildings is a concern of governments at national, state and local level as well as the private sector. In this they share a common goal to improve health and amenity. However, their focus can vary and the outcomes compare like chalk and cheese. The National Construction Code of Australia (NCC) contains requirements for setbacks, light wells and windows that are seen as a minimum, necessary to maintain health and safety. Amenity is not the concern of the NCC. The state government apartment guidelines have requirements for setbacks, light wells etc generally in excess of the minimum provisions contained in the NCC. The aim is to provide ‘adequate’ daylight rather than a minimum. The local council developed tool is called BESS. It promotes deemed to satisfy (DTS) measures for daylighting that are a close match to the state government apartment guidelines (apart from room depth and orientation issues). It also provides an alternative for modelling. However, to pass the modelling BESS requires 80% of living rooms and bedrooms to meet its daylight target. In a large residential tower surrounded by similar buildings this requirement has proved difficult to achieve. Passing the BESS tool is seen as ‘best practice’ by these local councils. The Green Star tool, a voluntary tool developed by the Green Building Council of Australia (not a state or local government authority), has had methods of benchmarking and assessing daylighting for some time. It is recognised as containing the benchmarks for national best practice, national excellence and international best practice. Interestingly, the Green Star tool ignores daylighting in bedrooms and encourages designers to place the kitchen prominently in the best daylit part of the apartment. The state guidelines and BESS on the other hand both expect bedroom daylighting to be assessed and encourage kitchens to be as far removed from the perimeter as possible. While there are some similarities of intent above, the differences in application and resultant design outcomes can be significant. At the moment these tools co-exist but don’t mesh. The inconsistences make claims of equivalence or even comparisons of merit difficult. A solution is required to bridge the gap between the tools, a solution that will correlate their various outputs and align them, perhaps on a scale from minimum compliance to best practice as has been flagged above. The NCC will always define minimum compliance and Green Star will always aim for the opposite end of the spectrum. The State government apartment guidelines had a difficult gestation, arrived quite diluted and are unlikely to evolve anytime soon. The BESS tool is the most dynamic of those discussed. Perhaps it is within the reach of BESS to find a way to calibrate the outcomes from the various assessment methods. But important questions will need a resolution such as should the daylighting requirement in bedrooms be dispensed with? Should kitchens be near or far from the perimeter?, What are the right daylight targets? What is an acceptable number of apartments that can fail the test in a large development?, and should each room be assessed individually or the development as a whole?One idea is to have the BESS tool acknowledge the existence of the state government apartment guidelines, align their physical requirements and give a project an ‘adequate score’ for meeting these. An increased score could then be offered for going above and beyond by satisfying the BESS daylight targets. In this way a project could provide adequate daylight and not appear as a ‘fail’ in BESS. If BESS were to introduce an ‘adequate’ benchmark in its scoring mechanism then it could be used to assess (and compare) the full range of projects from minimum compliance to best practice and beyond. This may go some way to establishing an accepted correlation between tools and design outcomes. If the design industry cannot establish some common ground or a bridge between these tools it may be left for VCAT to determine the correlations, one case at a time, with all the potential chaos and perverse interpretations that a narrowly focused decision might spawn.

Similar releases of land may take place over the next few years, some of them more remote than others. Here are our top ten ESD initiatives we’d like to see incorporated into the planning guidelines for a new suburb:  Ensure effective public transport is present and available from day one.  Plan for supporting activities, retail, office and community support facilities.  Plan for safe bike and pedestrian movement, with connected paths and green spaces to enable safe movement across and within the development. If there is a new school is should be at the nexus of a web of these paths and green zones and the school should be available for all, day and night.  Electric bikes and cars should receive encouragement and support (public charging stations).  Multi storey dwellings should be high performance and comply with the BADS apartment guidelines.   However, greater trade-offs should be considered between well delivered communal spaces (including green roofs) and daylighting in apartments.  Significant renewable energy generation on site and interlinked systems to help power local public utilities such as waste water treatment, street lighting, the local school etc.  Planting pallets should by local, indigenous and/or fruit bearing.  Rainwater capture and reuse, consolidated stormwater treatment and recycling of same for reuse in irrigation.  Community gardens, markets.  Share economy motivators, e. g. Transition Town Networks"

    "body": "2017/10/20 - With an increasing amount of research and information available on the impacts that buildings have on people’s wellbeing, healthy building design is rapidly becoming a hot topic. Currently, much of the conversation is related to office buildings, where the economic impacts of absenteeism and presenteeism and other sick building syndrome-related issues are driving the design of healthy and more productive spaces. However, the principles of healthy design can be applied to all building typologies, from residential dwellings to hospital and sport facilities, with benefits ranging from faster injury recovery, increased performance, increased mental and physical wellbeing, and increased sense of community and place. As for other sustainable design practices, in order to demonstrate what a building has achieved and preparing a business case for further improvements a range of tolls are currently available in the Australian market to measure Indoor Environment Quality (IEQ). These include: the WELL Building Standard, Green Star and NABERS IE. NABERS IE entered the market in 2009 with the intention to offer a benchmark and management tool that could assist the implementation of initiatives aimed at creating better working environments. As for other NABERS tools, the IE tool is all about taking measurements of particular criteria related to IEQ conditions during building operation. Measurements are taken for thermal services, indoor air quality, lighting, acoustics, and office layout. Green Star, with its various tools, also addresses IEQ-related issues such as fresh air requirements, pollutants control, lighting quality, access to daylight and views, and particulate matters. For Design &amp; As Built and Interiors assessments, design specifications and proofs of installation/compliance must be presented, while for Performance assessments on-site measurements are also taken during operation. The WELL Building Standard is the newest tool to enter the Australian market and is getting a lot of attention, especially at the top end of town where the cost and effort of implementing can be more easily justified. WELL takes a holistic approach to healthy buildings by including tenants and their practices into the assessment. In fact the tool not only looks at the physical aspects of a building, it also focuses on people, mindful design, wellbeing programs, workplace culture, etc. . The decision to use one tool over another, or a combination of all of these, whether to go for formal accreditation of self-assessment, should be taken based on the desired outcome. In particular consideration should be given to the audience to which the results will be communicated to, the reporting requirements for a particular project or business, and the level of advantage that the company wishes to achieve over its competitors.

    "body": "2017/10/18 - It has long been acknowledged that access to fresh air is critical for peak performance and health, whether a person is working in office or learning in a classroom. Whilst operable windows and cross flow ventilation can offer good levels of fresh air and natural cooling there will be times when ambient conditions are unfavourable. At such times occupants will want to and should be able to close windows. In much of Victoria the incidence of hot summer afternoons and cold winter mornings are frequent enough to warrant a back up supply of tempered fresh air. The latest generation of Victorian government schools are addressing the need for back up of tempered fresh air by introducing low energy systems that take advantage of conditions such as diurnal swings and thermal mass storage. An article in the Ecolibrium October 2010 edition detailed the system adopted at the Meadows Primary School in Victoria (by NOW Architecture)where water was used as a thermal storage system through which ventilation pipes drew air to be cooled. The Mt Clear Earth and Science Centre designed with SBE responded to the same demand for tempered fresh air by incorporating a ground coupled thermal labyrinth and was the focus of another article in Ecolibrium in 2011. The graph shown above demonstrates how ambient air at 5pm is cooled from 30°C to 22°C after being drawn through the labyrinth. "

    "img": "/uploads/blog-what-to-expect-from-section-j-ncc-2019.jpg",
    "body": "2017/10/17 - As many of you already know, the NCC has moved to a three-year update cycle, with the next version of the NCC planned to come into effect in May 2019. As part of this process the ABCB is conducting a line-by-line review of the Code with the scope to make it shorter, simpler, more flexible, but also more stringent where justified by economic criteria. Below we summarise some of the proposed changes to Section J with particular emphasis to Part J1 to J3. We also note that the proposed changes are not definitive, as the ABCB is still in the process of reviewing and consulting with industry in preparation for issuing a draft NCC 2019 and beginning a formal consultation period in February 2018. The first proposed change relates to the inclusion of Green Star and NABERS simulation protocols as part of the Performance Solution approach. This means that if your project has undergone simulation as part of one of those voluntary certification schemes and has achieved specified improvements over a base case, there won’t be the need to conduct a separate simulation to demonstrate compliance with Section J. The reasoning behind this change is to allow more flexibility into the compliance process, avoid unnecessary doubling up in simulation requirements, and encourage the industry to adopt Performance Solutions more frequently rather than relying on DTS provisions that may not benefit all types of design. While there will be a push for broader use of the Performance Solution methods, the DTS provisions are also being reviewed and not surprisingly, the glazing requirements of Part J2 are a main area of focus. This is because windows play an important role in the energy efficiency and comfort of a building, and also because the length and complexity of the current Part J2 often leads to compliant solution actually been found non-compliant when investigated further. While the specifics are still under review, the key messages are that Part J2 will be significantly simplified; and that façades with no external shading will be allowed very small windows compared to façades that integrate a combination of appropriate shading and performance glass, where WWRs of about 80% could be achieved. Another important change related to glazing involves the possibility to ‘trade-off’ between façades, meaning that from 2019 we may be able to compensate façades with high WWRs with façades with low WWRs to achieve overall compliance (something that we currently do following the Performance Solution verification method by engineering calculations). In relation to building fabric, wall insulations requirement will remain mainly unchanged or in some cases decrease slightly. However, thermal bridging requirements will be made clearer with the likely introduction of compliant construction methods. Light-coloured roof will also likely be mandated in most climate zones. Further, air-infiltration will be addressed with the likely introduction of maximum air-changes per hour (likely to be around 7) and blower-door testing as a voluntary measure to demonstrate compliance. Finally, energy efficiency requirements for all building services will also become more stringent. These changes are projected to increase the energy efficiency of the Australian building stock by around 40% and thus contributing to the Nation’s goal to reduce emissions to 26-28 percent on 2005 levels by 2030. While some may view these changes as extreme, it is important to remember that the requirements of Section J haven’t be significantly revised or increased since 2011 leaving Australian buildings exposed to a number of risks ranging from low levels of occupant comfort to high energy demands and reliance on active systems to maintain safe operational parameters. In the words of Dr. Paul Bannister (the leading technical advisor and author of much of the research that is supporting the changes to Section J) ‘from an international point of view these changes won’t put Australia at the head of the pack, but will bring us back in the game and are a step in the right direction to ensure our buildings perform today and into the future’.

    "img": "/uploads/blog-eco-city-01.jpg",
    "body": "2017/05/02 - The term eco-city is increasingly becoming popular within the urban development industry to describe and market developments that incorporate ecological aspects in their design. But what is exactly an eco-city? To try to answer this question we attended the EcoCity World Summit that took place in Melbourne from the 12th to the 14th of July 2017. What is an eco-city: Defining what an eco-city is, is not easy task as many urban forms and planning models can encompass the characteristics of an eco-city. The main principles that the EcoCity World Summit identifies as been critical to an eco-city include:  Ecological principles – urban settlements should have a deep and integrated relationship with nature Economic principles – urban settlements should be based on an economy organised around social needs rather than growth Political principles – urban settlements should have an active emphasis on engaged and negotiated civic involvement Cultural principles – urban settlements should actively develop ongoing processes for dealing with the uncomfortable intersections of identity and difference, including the current tension between culture and natureIn practice an eco-city, similarly to a ‘traditional’ city, should provide all those elements such as a functional transport network and urban structure that support the social and economic prosperity of its dwellers. However, an eco-city should also enable social justice, and be a place where a mixture of cultures, identities, and beliefs coexist, enrich the city and thrive in harmony with the natural environment. In this sense, we argue that an eco-city should resemble a healthy ecosystem. Cities as ecosystems: Ecosystems work through the interaction of living and non-living organisms. Plants, animals, soil, water, heat, light, and air all work together to create a balanced system. Healthy ecosystems have plenty of species diversity, with each species having a niche in the ecosystem that keeps the whole system healthy and functional. Energy flows tend to be closed loop, where the ‘waste’ from one organism becomes the nutrient for another. This allows the ‘participants’ in the ecosystem to source the vast majority of the recourses they need locally (i. e. within the boundaries of the ecosystem). Translating these concepts into the design of a city is no doubt a huge challenge, especially when considering that each city must cater for its specific climatic, ecologic, geographic, historic, social and economic context. Furthermore, unless starting from scratch and having full control over the decision-making process, urban designers are required to work within the boundaries of current cities’ design, their existing infrastructures and political and legislative frameworks. Nonetheless, if we are to transform our cities from places where we live to places where we thrive, a drastic shift in the way we think about, plan and build our cities is required.   (The Gary Comer Youth Centre Roof Garden in Chicago)Examples of this shift already exist at various levels in various countries. Urban agriculture is becoming popular in many cities around the globe including Montreal, Melbourne, Puerto Madonado, Canberra, Detroit, Paris and many others. An increasing number of existing and proposed buildings are installing solar photovoltaic panels on their roofs to reduce their reliance on the energy grid and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Public transport are becoming more efficient, and car and bikes sharing schemes are been implemented continuously. Further, businesses are continuously coming up with ideas that help minimise waste by mimicking ecosystems. These are only some examples of how cities can become more ecosystem-like, and as designers and citizens involved in the shaping of the urban form we have the potential to assist transforming our cities into thriving places that offer equal opportunities to all its dwellers, foster a strong sense of community, and instil a sense of care, ownership and responsibility for place. Measuring the eco-city: For existing and proposed cities that wish to become an eco-city, the Sustainable Development Goals developed by the United Nations provides a useful framework to explore their potential and monitor their achievements. The Sustainable Development Goals includes a total of 17 goals, each outlining specific targets to be achieved over a period of 15 years. The goals range from ending poverty in all its forms to protect marine life. By achieving all the goals, a city gets closer to what may be defined as been an eco-city – a city where all of its inhabitants (living and non-living) thrive in harmony with the natural environment.

The development provides a significant upgrade to the current facility thus allowing Hillcrest to continue to offer high quality care to the ageing community of North Fremantle. A magnificent heritage listed ‘Hillcrest Residence’ is located in the south-eastern portion of the site and has been refurbished and incorporated into the redevelopment resulting in a significant improvement of the heritage value of the site. The development has been awarded 4 Star Green Star design under the Healthcare Design v1 tool and is now targeting as-built certification. The building has been designed to maximise views to the outdoor for occupants and building users, with 81% of internal spaces (excluding basement, ensuites and plant rooms) offering a direct line of sight to the external environment. Some other features that contributed to the Green Star rating include high efficiency air-conditioning and lighting, as well as low-flow sanitary fixtures and fittings, sustainable building materials, and low VOC interiors. Lessons learnt: The use of Green Star tools is now extremely well-understood by the majority of the industry and a number of criteria can be considered standard practice. Nonetheless, in order to ensure a successful project it is critical that the client is committed to target Green Star certification from the project inception, and that clear communication between all stakeholders is maintained throughout the design and construction phases. It is also very important that the appointed GSAP is able to convey the Green Star philosophy to the team and guide the various consultants through the specific requirements necessary to demonstrate compliance. In fact, the use of the ‘right’ language and format when compiling the evidence for the project is critical to minimise delays during the submission process. "
