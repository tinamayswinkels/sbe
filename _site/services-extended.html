       <h3> Sustainable Master Planning</h3>
       <p>Sustainable Master Planning involves considering the future by integrating sustainability and regenerative strategies into all phases of a master plan.</p>

<p>To ensure successful sustainable project outcomes are achieved, SBE recommends that an ESD framework be developed at early concept planning design phase to guide the evolution of the master plan. This framework is then developed and refined through the planning, design, construction and operation or management phases of the project.</p>

<p>SBE has developed a matrix that we can use to develop a framework specific to your project. Alternatively we can use official frameworks such as <strong><em><a href="http://www.bioregional.com/oneplanetliving/">One Planet Living</a></em></strong>, <strong><em><a href="http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/">Sustainable Development Goals</a></em></strong>, and <strong><em><a href="http://www.envirodevelopment.com.au/default.asp">EnviroDevelopment</a></em></strong> to guide the project towards the desired ESD outcome.</p>

       <h3> Town Planning</h3>
       <p>An increasing number of Local Governments are requiring Environmentally Sustainable Design (ESD) reports to be submitted as part of the Planning Permit Application. This requirement is formalised by the <strong><em><a href="http://imap.vic.gov.au/uploads/Strategy%20Documents/Strategy%209%20Actions%20Progress%20Reports/FINAL_Att%207a_Action%209.2_CASBE%20-%20SDAPP%20Fact%20Sheet%20-%20v1-2.pdf">Sustainable Design Assessment in the Planning Process (SDAPP)</a></em></strong> which refers to the consistent inclusion of key environmental performance considerations into the planning permit approvals process.</p>

<p>SBE is experienced in providing ESD reports (also called Sustainability Management Plans and/or Sustainability Design Assessments) to the satisfaction of the Responsible Planning Authority. We complete these assessments using the <strong><em><a href="http://www.bess.net.au/">Built Environment Sustainability Scorecard (BESS)</a></em></strong>, <strong><em><a href="http://new.gbca.org.au/">Green Star</a></em></strong> tools, <strong><em><a href="https://storm.melbournewater.com.au/">STORM</a></em></strong>, <strong><em><a href="http://ewater.org.au/products/music/">MUSIC</a></em></strong> and other industry tools as required. As a part of these assessments we also conduct energy and daylight modelling simulations and develop Green Travel Plans.</p>

       <h3> Building Permit</h3>
       <p>Compliance with Energy Efficiency requirements of the <strong><em><a href="http://www.abcb.gov.au/Resources/NCC">National Construction Code</a></em></strong> is an integral part of the building permit process. Where a building is proposed to comply with Section J or Part 2.6 of the NCC two methods are generally available to meet the Performance Requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Deemed-to-Satisfy (DTS) Solution</strong> – A DTS Solution uses the DTS Provisions and any referenced documents contained within the NCC. These provisions include prescriptive examples of materials, components, design factors, construction and installation methods, which if followed in full, are deemed to comply with the Performance Requirements of the NCC.</li>
  <li><strong>Performance Solution</strong> – A Performance Solution is any solution that can meet the Performance Requirements, other than a DTS Solution. A Performance Solution may differ in whole or part from the DTS Provisions, but will still meet the Performance Requirements as long as it can be successfully demonstrated to the Appropriate Authority how this will be achieved. When developing a Performance Solution, one or more of the following Assessment Method must be used:
    <ul>
      <li>Evidence of Suitability;</li>
      <li>Verifications Methods;</li>
      <li>Expert Judgement;</li>
      <li>Comparison with DTS Provisions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>SBE provides assessments following both the DTS and Performance Solution approaches. We regularly complete assessments following the JV3 and V2.6.2.2 Verification Methods, NatHERS modelling, DTS solutions, as well as specialised alternative compliance engineering calculations. As part of these assessments we actively seek to provide value-adding recommendations, optimisation measures and independent verification of contract documentation.</p>

       <h3> Voluntary Certification</h3>
       <p>Achieving third party sustainable building certification is an excellent way to demonstrate a project’s robust sustainability credentials. Certified sustainable buildings regularly outperform other non-certified buildings in social, economic and environmental indicators, and can benefit building owners by allowing them to market their assets as industry leading facilities.</p>

<p>SBE has extensive knowledge and experience in delivering voluntary certification services under a number of third party schemes including <strong><em><a href="http://new.gbca.org.au/">Green Star</a></em></strong>, <strong><em><a href="https://new.usgbc.org/leed">LEED</a></em></strong>, <strong><em><a href="https://www.wellcertified.com/en/start-a-project">WELL</a></em></strong> and the <strong><em><a href="https://living-future.org/lbc/">Living Building Challenge</a></em></strong>.</p>

<p>When working on a certification project, our staff will provide consulting services throughout the concept, planning, design and construction phases in order to guide the design team towards an holistic environmental design which achieves the client’s desired target.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Thermal and energy modelling</li>
  <li>Daylighting, glare and shading analysis</li>
  <li>Computational Fluid Dynamics</li>
  <li>Natural ventilation optimisation</li>
  <li>HVAC validations</li>
  <li>Resource efficiency opportunities</li>

       <h3> Building Physics</h3>
       <p>Building physics analyses the physical behaviour of buildings in their particular geographical contexts and how this impacts resource efficiency, comfort, indoor environmental quality and durability. </p>

<p>SBE starts by evaluating the climatic conditions of a proposed site and then uses analytical tools and building simulation software to optimise building orientation, layout and form. As part of this process we adopt the building as a system concept which recognises the interactions between the building enclosure, the building services, its inhabitants, the site and the external environment.</p>

<p>This holistic analysis process allows SBE to assist design teams harmonizing the various building elements and physical mechanisms (e.g. heat flow, air flow, moisture flow and solar radiation) to create high-performing buildings.</p>

<p>SBE offers Level 1 and 2 energy audits according to Australian/New Zealand Standard. These audits range from simple desktop studies aimed at determining whether energy use is reasonable or excessive, to more detailed audits involving both desktop and field studies aimed at identifying areas where savings may be made, recommending measures to be taken, and providing a statement of costs and potential savings.</p>
