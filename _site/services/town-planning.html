<p>An increasing number of Local Governments are requiring Environmentally Sustainable Design (ESD) reports to be submitted as part of the Planning Permit Application. This requirement is formalised by the <strong><em><a href="http://imap.vic.gov.au/uploads/Strategy%20Documents/Strategy%209%20Actions%20Progress%20Reports/FINAL_Att%207a_Action%209.2_CASBE%20-%20SDAPP%20Fact%20Sheet%20-%20v1-2.pdf">Sustainable Design Assessment in the Planning Process (SDAPP)</a></em></strong> which refers to the consistent inclusion of key environmental performance considerations into the planning permit approvals process.</p>

<p>SBE is experienced in providing ESD reports (also called Sustainability Management Plans and/or Sustainability Design Assessments) to the satisfaction of the Responsible Planning Authority. We complete these assessments using the <strong><em><a href="http://www.bess.net.au/">Built Environment Sustainability Scorecard (BESS)</a></em></strong>, <strong><em><a href="http://new.gbca.org.au/">Green Star</a></em></strong> tools, <strong><em><a href="https://storm.melbournewater.com.au/">STORM</a></em></strong>, <strong><em><a href="http://ewater.org.au/products/music/">MUSIC</a></em></strong> and other industry tools as required. As a part of these assessments we also conduct energy and daylight modelling simulations and develop Green Travel Plans.</p>
