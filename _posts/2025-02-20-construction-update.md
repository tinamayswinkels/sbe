**3: Kinross Woolshed Pub**

Soon to be completed the Kinross Pub in Thurgoona NSW will provide food, entertainment (including a bowling alley and gaming room) as well as pleasant indoor and outdoor spaces for socialising. This project was an interesting challenge as it retains much of its original structure and claddings – some of which have a long history. Designed by Techne Architects and being constructed by Fugen Constructions.
