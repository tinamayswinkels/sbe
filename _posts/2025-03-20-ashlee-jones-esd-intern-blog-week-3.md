Week 3 Blog

Welcome back to my blog! A big week of learnings this week. We started off with finishing the sustainability action plan (SAP) for a Queensland accommodation development. Analysing the design in terms of the ESD considerations was one thing, but I got to apply my knowledge (and Seans expertise) by recommending enhancements so the project can improve its sustainability outcome and have a higher SAP score.

I was involved in a residential project pin up by HSPC. It was focused on the work of the other interns, Alesha and Erin. Some of the experts in the room commented on the beautiful artistic visual expression as well as provided guidance on areas to improve, like window detailing so that the horizontal and vertical linework worked harmoniously. I have also started learning a new program called ETool to conduct lifecycle assessments, calculate Net Zero rankings and green star reports which I am super excited to start using and also teach others in the office (once I become a pro at it!).
