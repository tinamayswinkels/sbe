SBE is celebrating its 15th Successful Green Star project with the awarding of a 6 Stars Interiors Rating (World’s Best Practice) from the Green Building Council of Australia for a multi-level Fitout (7,820m2) at 555 Collins Street in Melbourne, Australia.  The client and occupants are the Superannuation firm Aware Super.

SBE collaborated with Aston Engineering Consultants, Future Space Interior Architects, Generate Property Group Project Managers, Buildcorp the Head Contractors and the Commissioning Agents Commissioning & Advisory to deliver this successful Green Star outcome.

The Fitout boasts a 5.5 star NABERS (energy) rating with a clear commitment to Carbon Neutrality for the duration of its operation. Staff will enjoy the benefits of good daylighting, thermal comfort and acoustics, increased fresh air rates, reduced indoor pollutants and extensive planting throughout.  They also have access to elaborate End of Trip facilities.  Furniture, appliances and finishes were all selected with a careful eye on reduced environmental impact, increased recycled content and sustainable procurement.

We are confident that the staff will continue to benefit from these new, healthy, and vibrant facilities in the long term. We also extend our congratulations to Aware Super for their commitment to their employees and their Corporate Environmental objectives.
