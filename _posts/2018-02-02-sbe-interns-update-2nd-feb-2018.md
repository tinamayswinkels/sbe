<font face="Calibri"><font size="3"><font color="#000000">Finally, week of submission of our design for BDAV competition. This week, we have been working intensively on our design and finalising it. We achieved 10 stars on FirstRate and then started working on the design layout, to make it visually interesting. Different design layouts were made, and we brainstormed on the passive design features that can be implemented in our design to make it most sustainable, energy efficient and pocket friendly. We emphasised on use of solar panels, rain water harvesting and its filtration, use of recycled material for construction, urban gardening and green roof. Also, the house rating was tested in all different climatic zones of Australia, and it never got a rating below 7.4, making it suitable for all locations (and minor changes lead to higher rating everywhere). Thanks to Sean and Rob for their valuable ideas and help, without which we would have not been able to complete our design. Hoping to do well at the competition and impressing the judges with our design.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</font></font></font>

<font color="#000000"><font face="Cambria"><font size="3">This week for me has mainly consisted of rendering our design using Lumion Pro 8 and Photoshop. Lumion is a rendering program that I haven&rsquo;t used before, but thanks to a little (read: a lot) of instruction from the other young architects at the firm I managed to produce some decent results. Now we&rsquo;re just laying out the drawings, renders and research we have done over the past 6 weeks to submit on Monday by 4pm. </font></font></font>

<font size="3"><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman">Time is going very fast and this is our final week to work on the design competition. All of us were 100% focus on the design competition this week. Each of us were doing different sections for our design competition. For the whole week, I was concentrating on researching earth berm and solar system for the house. Basically, the earth berm house has many advantages such as strong structural strength and saving many spaces. Based on the research, there are more and more sustainable house used an earth berm structure in the world. Also, I decided to use a 5kW solar system for this sustainable house because it can generate more energy. There is also a storing battery which can store the energy during the day and use it at night when the solar panels are not working. Poornima was trying to achieve 10-star rating on Firstrate5 and writing the specification for elements. Leah was mainly completing the design of the house and generating the 3D images for this sustainable house. By the end of this week, we have almost finished the design competition. On the weekend, we will work home to make sure the whole design finished and submit it before the due date. &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></font></font>
