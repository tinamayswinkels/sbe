Firstly, I would like to thank Sean and Rob for giving me the opportunity to work with them even during these difficult times.&nbsp;

During these three months I have learnt a lot, specifically the Australian standards for sustainable building design, and tools and techniques used in the ESD space. Even though I had experience in this industry and softwares prior to joining SBE, the standards and the construction methods vary in every country and my experience with SBE has helped me garner all the knowledge that I need to continue working in this industry.&nbsp;

It was quite a learning experience for me, especially the NCC 2019 section J compliance for buildings, IES modelling and FR5 tool for NatHERS assessment. I am happy that I have had the opportunity to work on a gamut of projects and have gotten an overall idea and hands-on experience on the tools and environmental assessments performed for buildings in Victoria for building permit and town planning&nbsp;

I am thankful to Sean and Rob for being a good mentor and for guiding me on the right path. I will always be thankful to you both - I only hope I can return the favor sometime in the future

Thanks & Regards,

Prat
