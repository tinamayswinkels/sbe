subtitle: Itâ€™s Week 2 and we are slowly getting the hang of it.
description: >-
  Our first project at 367 KEILOR RD is a mixed-use development with 21
  dwellings and 2 commercial units.  We completed NatHERS ratings using the FR5
  tool which is a mandatory requirement for BESS and calculated the on-site
  reuse of stormwater under the guidance of Rob.  We also attended a meeting
  with the developers of a new stormwater tool which was exciting.

  Our next day was super lit!  We carried out the daylight analysis for the
  apartments. Sean patiently taught us to carry out the task. Most of the
  apartments we modelled met the desired threshold but not enough. We
  brainstormed methods to improve the daylighting and presented the ideas to the
  architect for their consideration.

  We then moved on to our next project which client required preliminary energy
  ratings to be done. It was for a large multi storey residential building
  located in Footscray. We had some concerns in achieving the cooling loads, but
  Rob was our saviour and helped us through it. The apartments passed
  assessments and we got them to a 7.7 star average.

  Finally we got to go for our first site visit. Steve Kasinski, the project
  architect from PTA, volunteered to take us on the site for the nearly
  completed leisure centre in East Keilor.  The client is the Moonee Valley City
  Council. The site visit was a rewarding experience.  The process, the
  engagement between the architects, builders, project managers, site
  supervisors was very revealing. Be it the age-old fight between engineers and
  architects, his experiences of the projects or even cricket; Steve lead us on
  some very engaging conversations to and from the site!

  It was a long week and full of learning; new adventures and an adrenaline rush
  to meet the deadlines!
