Week 5:

This week was pretty productive in terms of final submissions.

We successfully completed the BESS rating for 2 projects. The first one was the 367 Keilor Rd, Essendon development which we have been talking about in our previous blogs. Our only hiccup was that one of the dwellings had not achieved the required cooling threshold. The brainstorming session continued and we realized that reducing the window size and providing sunshade affected the loads drastically. This did affect the daylight a bit, but was not an issues as the other dwellings were achieving more than 90% of daylight. This project has achieved a BESS score of 51%. The IEQ (Indoor Environment Quality) category contributed the maximum points in areas such as providing adequate daylight and natural ventilation. Therefore, the brainstorming sessions were quite fruitful. &nbsp;

Our second project, 103 Capital Avenue at Glen Waverly was a multi-unit residential development. This project is a NCC class 1a development consisting of 3 town house dwelling. We performed the preliminary NatHERS Rating for which we had to do a few iterations in terms of building fabric R value assumption. The building therefore achieved an overall 7 star NatHERS rating by considering a significant amount of building fabric insulation and a high performance glass. This project has achieved a BESS score of 58%.

We therefore got to learn a lot about BESS rating for class 1 and Class 2 to 9 - mixed used development.
