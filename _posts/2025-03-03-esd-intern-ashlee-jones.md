Hi, my name is Ashlee Jones.

Today I am beginning an internship in ESD at SBE and Peddle Thorp. I have completed my Bachelor’s Degree in Design (Architecture) and I am using this internship to upskill myself before I continue my studies with a master’s degree in July. Outside of Architecture I love to travel and participate sports with cycling being my favourite. The purpose of this blog is to write about work activities, so I can reflect back on the learnings and skills that I gained during my time at SBE. Some targets or aspirations I have during this internship are to assist SBE with progressing designs to reach greater sustainable outcomes. This includes producing ESD modelling for building permits and town planning documentation.

Being collocated with Peddle Thorp/HSBC will offer me the opportunity to collaborate across different project types and stages of delivery. I’m particularly looking forward to exploring health-based architecture, spatial planning and implementation of ESD back into the design process. This will also allow me to connect with other PTA/HSBC employees and build up my network.

In terms of skills, I am excited to continue strengthening my capabilities with the Speckel and Revit interface. Some focused work will include ventilation strategies, daylight modelling, airflow networks and carbon accounting. I also want to continue learning Lumion and explore Speckel model conversions between Rhino and Sketchup.
