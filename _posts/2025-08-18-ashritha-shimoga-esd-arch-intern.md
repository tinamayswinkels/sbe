Hello, my name is Ashritha Shimoga, and I am currently in my final year of the Master of Architecture program at the University of Melbourne, with a specialisation in Environmental Design. I am a Green Star Accredited Professional (GSAP), and an active student member of both the Australian Passivhaus Association (APA) and the Australian Building Sustainability Association (ABSA).

I joined Peddle Thorp Architects and SBE as an Intern this week, where I’m excited to be contributing across a variety of sustainability-focused projects. My internship is centred around daylight and thermal modelling using EnergyPlus via the Better Building tool, as well as conducting assessments in line with NCC 2022 Section J1–7, J4–5 DTS, and JV3 compliance pathways. I will be involved in the development of Environmentally Sustainable Design (ESD) reports and gaining valuable exposure to real-world architectural practice. My main goal during this internship is to deepen my knowledge and practical skill set in the area of sustainable and performance-driven building design.

Currently, I am working on a sustainable design platform called Better Building. This tool analyses various environmental performance factors such as daylight, carbon, energy, and moisture to support the design of more sustainable and energy-efficient buildings.

In my first week, I began working on a propsoed Hospital project. I assisted in creating a 3D model that supports sustainable design assessments and compliance analysis, providing valuable insights into early-stage design evaluation.

Overall, I’m incredibly grateful for the opportunity to contribute to meaningful projects at Peddle Thorp and SBE, and I look forward to building on my passion for environmentally sustainable architecture.
