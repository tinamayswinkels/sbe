As we move out of lockdown and the way Victoria is tackling the pandemic situation we are now back in business\!&nbsp;

Introducing our interns for the year 2021, meet Pratidnya Bhuite, a civil engineer and Pooja Vaidya, an architect the ultimate combination of engineering and architect brain. The Interns will focus on learning new software, environmentally sustainable design techniques, and collaborative learning. Working together as a team, they will focus on various rating tools and standards along with town planning to develop a sustainable community.&nbsp;

Pratidnya Bhuite:&nbsp;

Hi\! it's Pratidnya but you can call me Prat\!&nbsp;

Must say I am super excited to join SBE after the Pandemic which has in some or the other way affected everyone around the world. With a good positive start this year, I am hoping to learn and progress forward within the field of sustainable development that I am really passionate about. Coming from a civil engineering background and having experience with the National Green building rating body of India the GRIHA Council, I am excited to move into the Australian market of the built environment and learn new skills during this internship.&nbsp;

I Believe in modern principles and practices of civil engineering especially in the area of sustainability within the construction industry and its application in projects which advocate sustainable development — SBE’s internship program perfectly aligns with my career goals and the vision of my personal mission and purpose.&nbsp;

Pooja Vaidya:&nbsp;

Hello Everyone I am Pooja being an architect I am eager on the design side of the buildings but with the sustainability major I also would like to engage into practical association of the both while interning with SBE and Peddle Thorp group.&nbsp; I would like to ensure I get involved with all kinds of projects and get a major hands on experience regarding the Green Buildings and other efficiency tools.

This week has been productive as we start with our training on FR5 tools along with an amazing lunch with the team and discussion on the different climate zones of Victoria on day one followed by hands-on experience on the FR5 tool. Day 2 begins with an introduction to BESS rating tool and training on the BESS assessment for a mixed-use development. And here we get our 1st project to work, the 367 KEILOR RD project for BESS assessment along with FR5 use for NatHERS rating and more to come…

Stay posted on this blog for our progress on the 1st project\!\!
