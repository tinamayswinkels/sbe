Blog Week 10

This week marked significant strides in my architectural journey.

I had the opportunity to explore a new area of health architecture by contributing to the concept design of Tower B at Cabrini Hospital Melbourne. Collaborating closely with Gabrielle Buckley and Stephen Sinclair (HSPC Architects), I gained valuable insights into the early design process. The team focused on creating a central heart for the hospital, integrating the existing church, enhancing ground presence, optimizing car parking and emergency vehicle access, maximizing natural light, and improving wayfinding. A key objective was to establish a seamless connection with the existing buildings.

My role involved tidying up the revit model, mapping the topography and site context to assist the team in determining potential demolition areas and further development. Thanks so much for Gabrielle and Stephen’s guidance throughout this process, it was great to work alongside them and hear their big ideas and architectural brains at work. I’m excited to see how this project progresses.

On the digital front, I’ve made significant progress with my Lumion animation. I’ve successfully combined elements such as the sliding clipping plane and layering effects. Currently, I’m refining the rotational camera movement to enhance the cinematic quality of the animation. Next week I will work on overall site context, rendering and visual elements to make it beautiful.

Reflecting on my initial goals for this internship, it’s rewarding to see how much I’ve learned and accomplished. Some things I have really struggled with but persisted and I am improving!! A special thanks to Sean for his continuous support and for connecting me into diverse architectural areas within the Peddle Thorp group.
