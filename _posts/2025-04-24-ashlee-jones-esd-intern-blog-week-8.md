Blog Week 8

I’m excited to share that I’ve been involved in the design documentation for the Devonport Sports Stadium (Tasmania). This experience has been a great opportunity to deepen my Revit workflow skills, especially in transferring and allocating families and work sets within the model.

In particular, I’ve been focusing on window elevations and schedules for the project. It is good to refine my foundational drawings skills and improve the overall tidiness of my documentation. This is good groundwork that will help me with my own architectural designs in the future. Thanks to Stephen Kasinski and Rob Alessi from Peddle Thorp for their guidance.

Another highlight this week was updating a daylight study for the Senior School building Stage 2 for Glenroy Private School (Victoria). This will be part of a series of sustainable design amendments to the 2022 proposal by McIldowie Partners Architects. The revised design introduced meeting rooms and a new performing arts stage area. Major impacts on daylight performance came from the perforated metal screens (shading device) installed over the balconies around the main stage space.

I’ve also received valuable advice from colleagues in the office on how to improve my animation work. I’m aiming to recreate the animation using phasing stages in Lumion. Although I’m still new to the software and rendering isn’t yet a strong suit of mine, I’m excited to put in the effort and grow in this area.
