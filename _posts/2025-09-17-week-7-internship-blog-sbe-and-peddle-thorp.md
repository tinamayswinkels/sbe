I have officially reached the halfway point of my internship with Peddle Thorp Architects and Sustainable Built Environments (SBE)!

On Monday, 15th September, I had the opportunity to attend the Design Student Society (DES) Industry Night, held at Cobblestone Pavilion, Meat Market. The event was hosted by the Melbourne School of Design (MSD) at the University of Melbourne, with this year’s theme being **“CONTINUUM: Honouring Legacy \| Designing Future.”**

**<br>The DES group has grown to over 1,000 student members, and events like this serve as valuable platforms for professional networking, skill-building, and strengthening connections within the broader design community.**

Representing the Peddle Thorp and SBE both was a rewarding experience. I had the opportunity to speak with many students about my current role and invaluable experiences as an intern. Having previously attended this event during my final year of undergraduate studies, it was insightful to return from the other side of the table not as a student seeking advice, but as someone now able to share my own journey and offer encouragement and share valuable insights and about the work Peddle Thorp, HSPC and SBE carries out.

Back in the office, I continued to deepen my technical skills by reviewing the Specification 44 course in the Better Building tool. This course is essential for conducting H6P1 (Thermal Performance) and H6P2 (Whole-of-Home) simulations, both of which rely heavily on correctly configuring the “Building” settings.

I then applied these learnings to a case study of Le Corbusier’s Villa Savoye, using the Better Building tool to explore its performance characteristics.

I am looking forward to diving into upcoming projects, assisting with reports, participating in team meetings and hopefully, some exiting site visits in the following weeks. I also look forward to start running the Specification 44 simulations for the case study.
