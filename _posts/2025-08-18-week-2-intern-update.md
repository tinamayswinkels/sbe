**Week 2 Internship Blog – Peddle Thorp and SBE**

&nbsp;

During week two of my internship at Peddle Thorp and SBE, I focused on resolving the building envelope details and successfully completed the modelling component of a propsoed Hospital project using the Better Building tool. This phase of the project provided me with a valuable opportunity to understand the complexities of thermal performance modelling and the impact of envelope detailing on energy efficiency.

I was also given the opportunity to conduct simulations under the J1V3 Building Assessment, in accordance with Section J of the NCC 2022 Building Code. Engaging with this regulatory framework enhanced my understanding of compliance requirements related to building sustainability and performance.

What stood out to me most was observing how each component whether a space type, construction material, or regulatory requirement can significantly influence a building’s overall sustainability profile. The level of precision and consideration required at every stage reaffirmed the importance of thoughtful design and detailed assessment. While using Better Building, the Part J4 Building Fabric report was not able to be geenrated as it required a longer time frame.

The Hospital project has been a particularly engaging learning experience for me. Running various simulations under current codes and standards highlighted the need for multiple design iterations to optimise performance. These adjustments could range from modifying the Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC) and Visible Light Transmittance (VLT) values of glazing, to refining the placement of horizontal and vertical shading devices along the building façade.

I am looking forward to beginning work on a new project next week and continue exploring further simulations using Better Building. I plan to apply the insights gained so far to enhance my technical skills and contribute meaningfully to upcoming sustainability assessments.
