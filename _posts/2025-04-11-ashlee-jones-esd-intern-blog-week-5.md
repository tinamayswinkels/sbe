Blog Week 6

This week’s skillset grew with animation creation. The task was to create a fly through animation that incorporated stages of a building progressing to a complete product. It was rough and required a lot of trial and error. I watched many different videos to get an understanding of how the process to create it.

I started with using Revit and exporting model versions to Lumion. This was okay however Lumion is slow and struggled to incorporate visibility changes. Next, I tried to export model versions into rhino and then create snapshots of the model stages. This was an effective method however due to the building being so large the workflow was slow. I could then create animations that moved through many snapshots and rendered in Enscape.

Some things to fix next week is transition speed and smoothness, quality of the rendering with materiality and adding in the structural frameworks that was slowing up the program lots. Learning this animation made me appreciate BIM processes and efficient workflows. I wasn’t very happy with my end product but a good snapshot of my learnings. I look forward to improving on this skill again!

I’m working with the Revit model created by Alex Davies from Peddle Thorp Architects. The project is their Ivanhoe Grammar Aquatic Centre which was recently constructed on the Plenty campus.
