**<u>Week 6 Internship Blog - Peddle Thorp and SBE</u>**

&nbsp;

During week six of my internship at Peddle Thorp and SBE, I had the opportunity to attend another site visit this time to the Wurdi Baierr Aquatic & Recreation Centre located in Torquay.

&nbsp;

Upon arrival, we met with Peter and other project managers to coordinate with stakeholders and review critical spatial requirements. This included verifying dimensions of key architectural elements and confirming the integration and alignment of building systems such as site drainage infrastructure. These on-site discussions ensured coordination between architectural intent and engineering requirements.

&nbsp;

We then participated in a formal RFI (Request for Information) meeting, where the team addressed outstanding design queries, discussed the progression and documentation of Stage 1 and Stage 2 construction drawings, and coordinated compliance with building permit conditions. Timelines and deliverables for upcoming milestones were also reviewed to ensure the project remains on schedule.

&nbsp;

On-site, the construction was at a significant stage of progress, with the primary steel structural framework being erected. There was also ongoing coordination around the selection and application of fa√ßade materials and internal finishes. Observing the scale and complexity of the aquatic centre project offered unique exposure to public and recreational architecture, which differs from the commercial and residential projects I had previously encountered.

&nbsp;

The site visit broadened my understanding of construction sequencing, stakeholder collaboration, and real-world application of design documentation. I look forward to future site visits, in-office tasks, and external engagements throughout the remainder of my vocational placement with Peddle Thorp and SBE as the hands-on experience and professional exposure I am gaining will be invaluable as I pursue a future career in architecture and environmentally sustainable design (ESD).
