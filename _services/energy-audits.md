SBE is experienced in conducting energy audits of existing buildings and develop business cases to support the implementation of energy efficiency measures which can result in financial, operational and environmental benefits.

SBE offers Level 1 and 2 energy audits according to Australian/New Zealand Standard. These audits range from simple desktop studies aimed at determining whether energy use is reasonable or excessive, to more detailed audits involving both desktop and field studies aimed at identifying areas where savings may be made, recommending measures to be taken, and providing a statement of costs and potential savings.
