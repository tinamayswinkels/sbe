Building physics analyses the physical behaviour of buildings in their particular geographical contexts and how this impacts resource efficiency, comfort, indoor environmental quality and durability.

SBE starts by evaluating the climatic conditions of a proposed site and then uses analytical tools and building simulation software to optimise building orientation, layout and form. As part of this process we adopt the building as a system concept which recognises the interactions between the building enclosure, the building services, its inhabitants, the site and the external environment.

This holistic analysis process allows SBE to assist design teams harmonizing the various building elements and physical mechanisms (e.g. heat flow, air flow, moisture flow and solar radiation) to create high-performing buildings.
