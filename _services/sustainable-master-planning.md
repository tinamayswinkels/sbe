An increasing number of Local Governments are requiring Environmentally Sustainable Design (ESD) reports to be submitted as part of the Planning Permit Application. This requirement is formalised by the ***[Sustainable Design Assessment in the Planning Process (SDAPP)](http://imap.vic.gov.au/uploads/Strategy%20Documents/Strategy%209%20Actions%20Progress%20Reports/FINAL_Att%207a_Action%209.2_CASBE%20-%20SDAPP%20Fact%20Sheet%20-%20v1-2.pdf)*** which refers to the consistent inclusion of key environmental performance considerations into the planning permit approvals process.

SBE is experienced in providing ESD reports (also called Sustainability Management Plans and/or Sustainability Design Assessments) to the satisfaction of the Responsible Planning Authority. We complete these assessments using the ***[Built Environment Sustainability Scorecard (BESS)](http://www.bess.net.au/)***, ***[Green Star](http://new.gbca.org.au/)*** tools, [STORM](https://storm.melbournewater.com.au/), [MUSIC](http://ewater.org.au/products/music/) and other industry tools as required. As a part of these assessments we also conduct energy and daylight modelling simulations and develop Green Travel Plans.
