As a forward-looking company, SBE believes in taking an innovative approach to improving the environmental outcomes of the built environment. We believe that research is the key to innovation and are keen to be active in the space and further pursue our links with academia. Over the years we have been involved in a broad range of research projects to inform ESD guidelines, tools, and policies, and to broaden our understanding of ESD solutions and the built environment.

Our research ability covers a broad range of topics including materials, climate change impacts, climate adaptation, policy and ESD tool development, eco-city and smart cities, building systems and technologies, and building physics.

Some of our research projects include:

* Climate Change Impacts on Buildings Energy Performance
* Better Apartment Design Guide
* DEH ESD Design Guide
* DEH ESD Operations Guide
* Greening Your Building: Improving Asset Performance
* Your Building
* Doncaster Hill Precinct Energy Plan
* ESD Guidelines and thermal comfort studies for the Victorian Department of Education and Training
* International Comparison of House Energy Rating tools
