SBE provides a comprehensive suite of building simulation services designed to assess and optimise building performance. Some of these services include:

* Thermal and energy modelling
* Daylighting, glare and shading analysis
* Computational Fluid Dynamics
* Natural ventilation optimisation
* HVAC validations
* Resource efficiency opportunities

Depending on the projectâ€™s requirement, the results obtained from simulations can be used to compare design solutions, validate design choices, predict performance outcomes, and report performance outcomes to relevant authorities and bodies.
