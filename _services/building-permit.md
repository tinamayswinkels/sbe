Compliance with Energy Efficiency requirements of the [National Construction Code](http://www.abcb.gov.au/Resources/NCC) is an integral part of the building permit process. Where a building is proposed to comply with Section J or Part 2.6 of the NCC two methods are generally available to meet the Performance Requirements:

* **Deemed-to-Satisfy (DTS) Solution** – A DTS Solution uses the DTS Provisions and any referenced documents contained within the NCC. These provisions include prescriptive examples of materials, components, design factors, construction and installation methods, which if followed in full, are deemed to comply with the Performance Requirements of the NCC.
* **Performance Solution** – A Performance Solution is any solution that can meet the Performance Requirements, other than a DTS Solution. A Performance Solution may differ in whole or part from the DTS Provisions, but will still meet the Performance Requirements as long as it can be successfully demonstrated to the Appropriate Authority how this will be achieved. When developing a Performance Solution, one or more of the following Assessment Method must be used:
  * Evidence of Suitability;
  * Verifications Methods;
  * Expert Judgement;
  * Comparison with DTS Provisions.

SBE provides assessments following both the DTS and Performance Solution approaches. We regularly complete assessments following the JV3 and V2.6.2.2 Verification Methods, NatHERS modelling, DTS solutions, as well as specialised alternative compliance engineering calculations. As part of these assessments we actively seek to provide value-adding recommendations, optimisation measures and independent verification of contract documentation.
