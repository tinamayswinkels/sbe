<font face="Calibri"><font size="3"><font color="#000000">Finally, week of submission of our design for BDAV competition. This week, we have been working intensively on our design and finalising it. We achieved 10 stars on FirstRate and then started working on the design layout, to make it visually interesting. Different design layouts were made, and we brainstormed on the passive design features that can be implemented in our design to make it most sustainable, energy efficient and pocket friendly. We emphasised on use of solar panels, rain water harvesting and its filtration, use of recycled material for construction, urban gardening and green roof. Also, the house rating was tested in all different climatic zones of Australia, and it never got a rating below 7.4, making it suitable for all locations (and minor changes lead to higher rating everywhere). Thanks to Sean and Rob for their valuable ideas and help, without which we would have not been able to complete our design. Hoping to do well at the competition and impressing the judges with our design.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</font></font></font>
