This week made it clear that I need to brush up on my Revit skills. I spent a good amount of time working on window elevations and plans for a Devonport sporting complex , and while it was a bit of a slow start, it felt good to revisit tools and workflows I hadn’t used in almost two years. There was definitely a bit of a learning curve in the beginning, but once I found my rhythm, things started falling into place.

One part of the process I found especially valuable was re-familiarizing myself with reference lines and using worksets to control visibility across different view templates. It reminded me to organize complex models for documentation clarity. I definitely want to keep refining my use of these features to make my workflow more efficient moving forward.

Big thanks to Stephen Kasinksi from Peddle Thorp this week for his patience and great teaching—it made a huge difference, especially while I was finding my feet again in Revit.

On a different note, the animation side of things continues to be a bit of a challenge. The positive news is that I was able to successfully incorporate the structural model of the Ivanhoe Grammar Aqutic Facility (Plenty Campus) into the rendered video, which helped the visuals feel more complete. I also started breaking down and refining the materials more.

That said, I’m still running into issues with the smoothness of the video output. The file size is quite large, and it’s been tough to record the animation cleanly in Enscape. My goal for next week is to reach out to a few people around the office and get some advice or tips on how to streamline the animation process and hopefully improve the playback quality. I’m sure someone’s cracked this problem before, so it’s time to tap into the collective wisdom here!
