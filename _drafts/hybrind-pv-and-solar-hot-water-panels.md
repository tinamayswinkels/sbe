SBE has been in discussion with Dr Yakov Elgart (details below) who is developing a local hybrid PV and solar hot water panel.

The concept is:

A PV panel kept cool performs at its optimum.

Extracting the heat from a PV panel produced hot water as a byproduct.

Investigation of experimental combined PV-TAHP collector (1600 x 1000) shown:

* Reduces heat-sensing surface by 30-40 % versus two most common collectors on the market : one PV and the other thermal, at the same power
* Absorber of PV-TAHP collector provides highly effective cooling of the PV cells area. That allows increase PV cells power output of around 15-30%, compare to single PV collector, by keeping its surface temperature around 40-50 C
* At temperature 40-50 C PV-TAHP collector’s electric power output is about 140 W/m2,at the same time it produces up to 450W/m2 of thermal energy
