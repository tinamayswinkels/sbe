We had all hands-on deck this week to wrap up the Design Documentation Drawings for the Devonport Stadium. Stephen reviewed and marked up the elevation drawings I worked on last week, giving me valuable feedback to help refine and finalise them for today’s package submission.

Some of the key improvements I made included adjusting and repositioning wall mullions, editing component families like mirrors, cubicles, doors, and carcass joinery, as well as refining material tagging and annotations. I really appreciate the guidance and time Stephen Kasinski (Peddle Thorp) has spent to teach me about revit and drawing skills. It’s been great to see both my technical detailing and speed to produce the drawings improve over the past few weeks.

A big thank you also to Sean for treating us interns to a lovely lunch at Southbank on Wednesday to celebrate reaching the halfway point of our internship. It was a great afternoon with Erin and Alicia, who are on a similar journey—if not a little ahead of me. We chatted about all things life, architecture, masters courses and what’s on the horizon for us.
