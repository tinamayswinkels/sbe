SBE has developed a Sustainaility Action Plan for PTA-HSPC in alignment with their ESG aspirations and in support of their comittment to Architect’s Declare. [Australian Architects Declare Climate & Biodiversity Emergency](https://architectsdeclare.com.au/)

The Sustainability Action Plan outlines a comprehensive framework for enhancing indoor environmental quality, health, and well-being while reducing the environmetal footprint of the building. They have nominated 8 criteria against which their architecture will be tested and benchmarked. They will use these criteria to evolve and report upon design outcomes. They will publish these outcomes.

The two distinguishing features of these criteria are that they are related to the passive performance the buildings (something within the architect’s direct control) and they are measurable. Thus, the evaluations of their (ESD) Accountabilities will be objective.

SBE will provide the modelling to evalute design outcomes in the following 8 criteria.

1. Passive energy (Orienitation, Planning, Building Fabric and Shading)
2. Energy Net zero (total operational consumption, genertaion and offsets)
3. Embodied Carbon (Materials)
4. Potable Water
5. Stormwater
6. Daylight
7. Thermal Comfort
8. Ventilation
