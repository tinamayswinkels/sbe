Final Blog Post for Week 12

That’s a wrap of my ESD internship at Peddle Thorp, HSPC and SBE. Reflecting on my journey, it's been incredible to contribute to a diverse range of projects—from healthcare facilities to sports, recreation, and aquatic centres; from multi-residential complexes to schools, religious buildings, and retail/service centres. I've developed a broad skill set across ESD and architecture, learned new software, and been mentored by some of Peddle Thorp's finest.

I began with energy consumption, town planning and daylight studies. I then progressed with carbon assessments and lifecycle analyses. I mastered new programs like Speckel, Lumion, and ETool, and enhanced my Revit skills. My work also included creating a detailed construction animation which you can find linked in my Linked In post. I have completed design documentation and construction packages, crafted competition design drawings, and prepared Section J DTS reports. Not to mention, some extensive site visits! The list goes on….

A heartfelt thanks to Sean for his time and patience. Working under his guidance has extended my understanding of ESD's role within architecture. I have particularly enjoyed the analysis side of things with evaluating how a building performs sustainably, and then provide enhancements for the design to improve. His mentorship has been invaluable, and I have felt part of the team!

This experience has influenced my future career direction. I've found my groove in ESD and also developed a passion for sports facilities, drawn from my personal athletic background and the intersection of architecture with elite-level sports.

Thanks to the Peddle Thorp, HSPC and SBE team for there support and guidance through the experience.

To see where I head in the future feel free to follow me on Linked In.

Best wishes,

Ashlee Jones
