# SBE Week 1 Blog

&nbsp;

Welcome back everyone, I am checking in after completing one week of my internship. I have already learnt how to complete a NCC Section J Report and created a Built Environment Sustainability Scorecard Report. Whilst completing the town planning work, I learnt how to conduct a storm water rating. I enjoyed seeing how the sustainability performance would change when factors like rainwater gardens or glazing was added to the design.

Additionally, I was involved in an innovation and technology meeting were staff members discussed how to improve the efficiency of digital tools used in the office. It was interesting to compare the digital tools taught at university vs how they are used in practice. I have also continued learning the Speckel interface with modelling and the effect of on the building performance. It was also fascinating to see how for energy efficiency of the building fabric was analysed and changed with wall to window ratios.

It was great to meet employees in the office and bond with other graduate students, Erin Judkins and Alicia Ding.  This is a picture of us at lunch.  Wednesday 5th March 2025.
