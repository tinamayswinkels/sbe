Ashlee Jones ESD Intern 2025

Week 2 Blog

&nbsp;

It is Week 2 of the internship and I am starting to get the hang of things. This week we focused on creating a sustainability action plan for a Qld Class 3 project that assesses the design against ESD outcomes.

It’s fascinating to understand how changing elements and building operations can improve the building performance. It was interesting to play with thermal barriers in wall types, adding more openable windows, changing material choices and occupancy comfort and seeing how the results changed.

Also, how well do you know the program if you can’t fix your own errors? Speckel struggled to create the carbon assessment and adaptive comfort analyses, mostly from user error. It required some time to understand the program better to find solutions to my problems. The tutorials and Sean are great teachers!

Also, it is nice to enjoy working in the city. I walked around the Yarra at lunchtime, taking in all the warmth and sunshine before the seasons change!
