**<u>Week 10 Internship Blog - Peddle Thorp and SBE</u>**

I started the week by reviewing the ESD Report I had prepared the previous week for a residential development located in Sandringham. This involved identifying and incorporating updates based on the latest STORM Rating Report calculations and results, ensuring accuracy and consistency with sustainability benchmarks.

This week I attended a product meeting with Kingspan. The focus of the meeting was on the facade material selection. Discussions included the proposed facade systems, their compliance with Australian building codes and regulations, and their performance in terms of cost-effectiveness and thermal performance. Key testing outcomes such as fire safety and blower door tests were reviewed to validate the materials' suitability.

I also started on a transportation analysis for a project in Docklands, referencing the  'Movement and Place' credit in the Green Star Buildings tool. Using the Green Star Excel-based Calculator, I input project-specific data in line with the brief to assess opportunities for enhancing sustainable transport solutions for the precinct.

Looking ahead to next week, I will continue updating the ESD report for the Sandringham project, as updated architectural drawings have been issued and final energy/NatHERS ratings are still pending. Additionally, I am eager to contribute to any new projects that may arise, as I approach the final phase of my internship experience which has been invaluable and greatly rewarding.
