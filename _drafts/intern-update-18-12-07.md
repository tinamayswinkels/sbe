Peddling off to a good start&nbsp;

(by Oscar Hiscock & Millie Siu)

26th November 2018 -&nbsp; 7th December 2018

Week 1: NCC Section J, BESS Test and ASA Conference

Our internship kickstarted at SBE with Sean walking us through the NCC Section J, which is currently the regulatory backbone of the minimum environmental performance in buildings. &nbsp;This eventually led to the learning outcomes of our ability to determine compliant window to wall ratios using a glazing calculator, and to carry out STORM water assessments for various commercial projects.

Finishing our works with SBE on Tuesday night, we attended the ASA (Architectural Science Association) conference at RMIT on behalf of SBE for 4 full days to gather useful insights on the current building trends for the company. Topics ranged from architectural philosophy to construction materials and processes, with keynote presentations from the renowned architects Jan Gehl and Gill Garner. The conference offered a plethora of built environment based researches which calls for better designs, backed by detailed case studies and building users’ feedback. We believe studying these pieces of information all together will be insightful for the industry to address building users’ needs, to improve on current design flaws and to mitigate issues specific to the built environment such as the urban heat island effect.

We will be happy to share with you what we’ve learnt at the conference.
