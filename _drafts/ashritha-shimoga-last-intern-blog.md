**Final Reflections with a note of thanks – Concluding My Internship at Peddle Thorp Architects and Sustainable Built Environments (SBE)**

And that concludes the end of my internship experience at Peddle Thorp Architects and Sustainable Built Environments (SBE)!

This week, I continued working on the ESD report for the residential project in Sandringham. My first task was to update sections of the report in line with the revised architectural floor plans and new sustainable design strategies incorporated into the project.

I was also introduced to a new calculator for stormwater management assessments, as the STORM Calculator is no longer in use. The new tool, BlueFactor, is specifically designed for small-scale developments in Victoria, Australia. It helps assess stormwater runoff and pollutant loads, ensuring compliance with local planning requirements and sustainability standards.

Once the ESD report was finalised, I incorporated the completed NatHERS and Whole of Home Assessment results. The NatHERS (Nationwide House Energy Rating Scheme) provides a star rating out of ten to measure the energy efficiency of residential designs. Meanwhile, the Whole of Home assessment evaluates the broader environmental performance of the dwelling, including appliances, renewable energy systems, and other efficiency measures.

Later in the day, I was asked to compile some drawing sets for the Devonport Stadium project. In architecture, it’s not often that students or graduates gain hands-on experience in compiling documentation sets - but its an essential step in preparing for reviews, feedback sessions, and mark-ups, so this was a great experience for me.

Reflecting on my three-month internship at Peddle Thorp and SBE, I can confidently say this experience has been incredibly valuable and one of the best experiences. I have developed practical skills, deepened my technical understanding, and gained the confidence to move forward in my architectural journey.

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Sean for his mentorship, patience, and invaluable guidance throughout my time here. It has been a privilege to learn from an expert in the industry like him. I also want to thank everyone at Peddle Thorp, HSPC, and SBE for their constant support, kindness, and encouragement especially to those who invited me to site visits and client meetings, which greatly enriched my learning experience.

As I now resume my university studies and work towards completing my Master of Architecture by June 2026, I look forward to seeing where the future leads me. To stay connected and follow my journey, feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn.
