<p>SBE was engaged by JBA Consulting Engineers to conduct the Section J Part J1-J3 Energy Efficiency assessment following the Alternative Verification method JV3. The modelling results demonstrate a 10% improvement of the building fabric when compared to an equivalent reference building. This was achieved with the retention of single glazed louvre windows, the specification of high performing glazing (total U-value of 2.8 and SHGC of 0.27), and typical insulation levels.</p>
