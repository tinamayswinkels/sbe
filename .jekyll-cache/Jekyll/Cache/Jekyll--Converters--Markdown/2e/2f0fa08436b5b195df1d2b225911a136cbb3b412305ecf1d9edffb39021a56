I"Õ<p>The 5 Star Green Star â€“ Education Design v1 Holmesglen TAFE Building 12 in Glen Waverley is a purpose-built three storey education facility. The building was a successful applicant project for a Commonwealth Education Investment Fund (EIF) grant for the construction of new learning spaces at the Waverley site.</p>

<p>The new $16.8M building provides facilities for Early Childhood Education, Vocational College and language programs together with general classrooms, PC labs, a lecture theatre and office space.</p>
