<p><em>**Let the good times roll! **</em></p>

<p>Itâ€™s finally my turn to say goodbye. Dramatically false alarmed everyone thinking my last day was on a Thursday (28 Feb) that is the last day of February whilst Sean actually planned for a Friday. Typical intern drama haha.</p>

<p>This week is a first taste of working a 5-day week with SBE and Iâ€™ve been kept busy. With the completion of 577 Little Collins Street report draft sent out to PTA Alex, (that took a bit longer than expected because it was a green star design and built template, something new to learn), Iâ€™ve alongside written a cover email drawing attention to the high glazing performance requirement (of course directly quoting Sean, but nevertheless I would say itâ€™s an evident improvement in my ability to write formal emails). Ending 577 Little Collins Street on a Tuesday, I have allowed the rest of the week for a new project, that is my last one with SBE, 83 Sydney Road mixed development in Brunswick.</p>

<p>The client is aware of the developmentâ€™s short in dimensions of lightwells per the requirement of the local council and hence required a daylighting assessment, together with standard ESD reports and online BESS.</p>

<p>Sydney Road, Brunswick, Daylighting = Yay! I live in the northern suburbs and Sydney Road is where the vibes are. Working on a project near your neighborhood is just so much fun coz you get to see the proposed development before everyone else sees it (then you can tell your neighbors, hey the Vietnamese baguette shop might be turned into a 5-story residential!)</p>

<p>Ah wells. Since this is my last blog, I really feel the need to sum up everything Iâ€™ve learnt and experienced in the past 12 weeks.</p>

<p>Software:</p>

<p>IES-VE</p>

<ul>
  <li>From academic knowledge and basic application to having the confidence to â€˜fix a broken model myselfâ€™ because â€˜Iâ€™ve got thisâ€™.</li>
  <li>From experiencing 40+ errors in 1 model and spending half a day fixing it to â€˜the model has 0 errorsâ€™ and is â€˜ready to run daylightingâ€™ in first attempt</li>
  <li>From thermal data not making sense and apache failing to â€œresults comply letâ€™s write the reportâ€ in first attempt</li>
</ul>

<p>FirstRate5</p>

<ul>
  <li>From requesting for more FR5 projects coz â€œIâ€™m not good at itâ€™ to â€œFR5 is a relatively easy software compared to IESâ€</li>
  <li>From â€œbreaking all the models Rob passed meâ€ to â€œletâ€™s see how we can get this to 6 starsâ€</li>
  <li>From â€œwhatâ€™s wrong with me coz all computers hate meâ€ to â€œah it must be that issue again. I know whatâ€™s wrong!â€</li>
</ul>

<p>Council Submissions and Reports</p>

<ul>
  <li>Understanding how to put bits and pieces together to complete a BESS report, i.e., Melbourne Stormwater Calculator, (which I have never used before) NatHERs results, identifying cross-ventilated rooms, Green Star potable water calculator, waste management plan, green travel plans etc.</li>
  <li>While the two software were like an *improvement* process, I feel like learning about reports is something *new* and doing things that Iâ€™ve never done before.</li>
</ul>

<p>Oscar, Sean and Rob</p>

<ul>
  <li>From questioning our self-worth as an intern to really feeling as a part of the SBE team.</li>
  <li>From strangers to coworkers that turned into Linkedin and Facebook connections that I will happily and definitely keep in touch wherever I go.</li>
</ul>

<p>*****Yay! SBE! *****</p>

<p>Thank you for having us for the past 12 weeks!</p>
