I"<p>SBE was commissioned to provide an Environmentally Sustainable Design (ESD) opportunities report for the proposed outdoor pool and grandstand redevelopment with the aim to provide an overview of the key sustainable design initiatives that could be integrated together with their predicted environmental sustainability outcomes (e.g. costs, savings, GHG emissions reductions, etc.).</p>

<p>SBE used examples from highly regarded national aquatic centres as inspiration for the initiatives proposed for this project which ranged from best practice pool filtration, backwash water recycling, rainwater collection and re-use, high-efficiency water heaters, integrated pool covers, pool insulation, as well as the use of prefabrication and sustainable materials amongst others.<br />Â </p>
