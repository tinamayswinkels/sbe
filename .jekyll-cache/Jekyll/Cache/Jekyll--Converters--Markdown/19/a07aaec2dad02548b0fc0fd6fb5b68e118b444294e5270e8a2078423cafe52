<p>As part of the project brief Wyndham City Council requested that the proposed design:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Achieved a minimum ESD score of 50% using the <strong><em><a href="http://www.bess.net.au/">Built Environment Scorecard (BESS)</a></em></strong>.</li>
  <li>Maximised hard surfaces connected to rainwater harvesting or WSUD treatments.</li>
  <li>Incorporated facilities that facilitate waste recycling.</li>
  <li>Be constructed with materials, finishes and fittings that meet Council ESD and sustainable procurement standards.</li>
  <li>Resulted in a connected, universal access facility that encourages and provides for all travel options including pedestrians, cyclists, public transport and motorised mobility devices.</li>
  <li>Be landscaped to provide urban heat refuge and enhanced ecological value to the site.</li>
</ul>

<p>As the project ESD consultant, SBE assisted the Architect and Project Team incorporating the necessary ESD initiatives into a practical and cost-effective design</p>
