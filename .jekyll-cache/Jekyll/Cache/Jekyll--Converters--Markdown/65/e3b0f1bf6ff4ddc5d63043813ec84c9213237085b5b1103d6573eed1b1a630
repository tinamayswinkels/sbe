I"á<p>SBE provided full ESD and Green Star Consultancy services for the Western BACE development.</p>

<p>In particular SBE conducted the necessary modelling for Green Star and Section J compliance, Â assisted the design team with the integration of Green Star and compiled the Green Star Design and As-Built Submissions.</p>

<p>This project achieved a 6 star design rating and a 5 star as-built Green Star rating and achieved maximum greenhouse gas reduction targets (base building carbon neutral).</p>

<p>ESD features included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Local wall mounted controllers to signal when to open windows.</li>
  <li>Primary conditioning is ducted heat recovery ventilator air system provides tempered outside air to all spaces . This system is sufficient to meet the heating and cooling loads for a large proportion of operating hours.</li>
  <li>Secondary Variable refrigerant volume HVAC on demand.</li>
  <li>Hydronic in slab system provides background heating and radiant sky based cooling.</li>
  <li>A 60kW PV array was located on the roof of the building providing an energy yield calculated to exceed the annual electrical demand from the base building.</li>
  <li>Base Building Carbon Neutral (Zero Greenhouse Gas emissions).</li>
</ul>
