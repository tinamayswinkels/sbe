<p>Subject: 10-Star Sustainable Design Challenge 2018</p>

<p>Hello, Lauren, Poornima, and Xiangting</p>

<p>Thank you for your submission in the BDAVâ€™s 10-Star Sustainable Design Challenge. The Judges have determined that a Certificate of Merit be awarded to you, in recognition of your efforts.Â </p>

<p>During their deliberations, the Judges made the following observations about your submission, which we share with you to assist you further develop your skills:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The submission has design merit, and has been well considered, with visual interest.</li>
  <li>The master bedroom seems disproportionate to the bed as shown, and the WIR underwhelming.</li>
  <li>The main passage is 1.5m wide suggesting accessibility is partially considered but it doesnâ€™t continue through with other integration. It may have needed a little more work on the flow of the building.</li>
  <li>A little more could have been be done on the presentation side of the documents, with improved indoor/outdoor connection.</li>
  <li>In reviewing the frate file, no allowance for an R-value of earth has been assumed to the roof. The R2.3 is to the rear metal portion - 100mm blanket under roof sheets.</li>
  <li>Therefore it could further be argued that the earth berm could be metal deck meaning handrail is not needed â€“ changes the appearance and design, but arguable.</li>
  <li>A couple of small errors in the assessment, but without a change in outcome.</li>
  <li>A slight reduction to 9.9 stars if we consider the plans show timber flooring, but tiles was used.</li>
</ul>

<p>Nonetheless, a well-considered submission, and worthy of a Certificate of Merit.</p>

<p>We appreciate the time and effort your collaboration put into this submission, and wish you every success as you all progress your career.</p>

<p>Regards</p>

<p>Giselle</p>
