I"Ú<p>With an increasing amount of research and information available on the impacts that buildings have on peopleâ€™s wellbeing, healthy building design is rapidly becoming a hot topic. Currently, much of the conversation is related to office buildings, where the economic impacts of absenteeism and presenteeism and other sick building syndrome-related issues are driving the design of healthy and more productive spaces. However, the principles of healthy design can be applied to all building typologies, from residential dwellings to hospital and sport facilities, with benefits ranging from faster injury recovery, increased performance, increased mental and physical wellbeing, and increased sense of community and place.</p>
