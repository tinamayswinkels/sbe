I"F<p>A new building for the Junior Campus to introduce the 5-6 students to the concept of ‘house’ and collective informal learning.  These are important experiences for the students destined to move on to the Woodleigh secondary school.</p>

<p>In addition to achieving good daylighting and increased guaranteed ventilation rates the design demonstrated significant savings in terms of energy consumption, green house gas emissions and operating costs.</p>

<p>SBE has provided specialised consultancy services in order to optimise the design. Building simulation results estimate that the proposed building  will have a total predicted energy consumption of 254 MJ/m²/p.a. (mix of gas and electricity) with resultant Greenhouse Gas emissions of 42.65 t/CO2/p.a. (26% saving). The predicted operating cost have been estimated at $4,706.00/p.a. (25% saving). Building simulation has also demonstrated that the proposed building achieves these savings while maintaining the desired comfort ranges, increased fresh air rates and a useful daylight factor of 2.5 to 43% of the floor plate.</p>
