I"ÿ<p>SBE has been in discussion (via AWS) with Dr Yakov Elgart (details below) who is developing a local hybrid PV and solar hot water panel.</p>

<p>The concept is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A PV panel kept cool performs at its optimum.</li>
  <li>Extracting the heat from a PV panel produces hot water as a by-product.</li>
</ul>

<p>SBE is interested in the technology for use in future Aquatic centres.Â  Dr Elgart has stated:</p>

<p><em>Investigation of experimental combined PV-TAHP collector (1600 x 1000) shown:</em></p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Reduces heat-sensing surface by 30-40 % versus two most common collectors on the market : one PV and the other thermal, at the same power</em></li>
  <li><em>Absorber of PV-TAHP collector provides highly effective cooling of the PV cells area. That allows increase PV cells power output of around 15-30%, compare to single PV collector, by keeping its surface temperature around 40-50 ï‚°C</em></li>
  <li><em>At temperature 40-50 ï‚°C PV-TAHP collectorâ€™s electric power output is about 140 W/m2, at the same time it produces up to 450W/m2 of thermal energy</em></li>
</ul>
