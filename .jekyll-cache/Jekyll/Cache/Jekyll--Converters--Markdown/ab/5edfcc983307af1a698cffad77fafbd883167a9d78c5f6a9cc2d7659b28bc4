I"	<p>SBE was engaged to conduct a NCC Section J Part J1-J3 assessment on the new Western Sydney Wanderers FC gymnasium.</p>

<p>The Verification Method JV3 assesses the annual energy consumption of the proposed building and compares it to the annual energy consumption of a reference building (i.e. a building modelled using the minimum DTS Provisions of Section J of the NCC). This approach allows certain ‘trade-offs’, such as reducing the performance requirements of windows below the minimum required using the DTS Provisions, by for example, increasing the requirements for walls, floors, roof insulation or building services.</p>

<p>By using this method on the project, SBE was able to maximise the glazed area on the project while maintaining overall efficiency.</p>
