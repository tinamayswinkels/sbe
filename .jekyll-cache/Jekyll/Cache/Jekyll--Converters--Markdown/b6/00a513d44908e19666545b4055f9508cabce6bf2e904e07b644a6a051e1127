I")<p>Sustainable Master Planning involves considering the future by integrating sustainability and regenerative strategies into all phases of a master plan.</p>

<p>To ensure successful sustainable project outcomes are achieved, SBE recommends that an ESD framework be developed at early concept planning design phase to guide the evolution of the master plan. This framework is then developed and refined through the planning, design, construction and operation or management phases of the project.</p>

<p>SBE has developed a matrix that we can use to develop a framework specific to your project. Alternatively we can use official frameworks such as <strong><em><a href="http://www.bioregional.com/oneplanetliving/">One Planet Living</a></em></strong>, <strong><em><a href="http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/">Sustainable Development Goals</a></em></strong>, and <strong><em><a href="http://www.envirodevelopment.com.au/default.asp">EnviroDevelopment</a></em></strong> to guide the project towards the desired ESD outcome.</p>
