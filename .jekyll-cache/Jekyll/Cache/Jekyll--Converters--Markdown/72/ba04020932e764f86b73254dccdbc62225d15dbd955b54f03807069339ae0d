<p>Estidama* was developed to assess the sustainable performance of new construction projects in the context of the Middle Eastâ€™s climate and culture. The program is not itself a green building rating system like LEED or BREEAM, but rather a collection of ideals that are imposed in an elective building code type of format. It provides both encouragement and a process for developers to gain recognition for the sustainable initiatives integrated into their projects. The program is voluntary.</p>

<p>Estidama guidelines include consideration for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Natural Systems</li>
  <li>Liveable City</li>
  <li>Resourceful Energy</li>
  <li>Precious Water</li>
  <li>Healthy Materials</li>
</ul>

<p>SBE assessed the project against the Estidama categories and referenced other sustainable methodologies that could be used to complement and inform the sustainable outcomes of the project.</p>
