I"2<p>SBE has a very successful track record with Daylight simulation studies, consulting and advice.</p>

<p>We use sophisticated engineering software to ensure the studies are accurate and informative and we will work with the architects to enable them to optimise daylighting performance, whether it be for amenity or compliance.</p>

<p>We offer modelling from early design exercises, through to Green Star submissions and VCAT representation. </p>

<p>Projects currently underway include a mixed use tower in Denmark Street Kew for KUD Architects, an office building in Easey Street in Collingwood for FGR Architects, a multi residential project in  Albion Street Brunswick for Six Degrees Architects and an Aquatic Centre in Traralgon for PTA Architects.<img src="/uploads/den-and-easey-combo.jpg" alt="" />.</p>
