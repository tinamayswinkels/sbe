I"R<p>The site is located within 500m of the Doncaster Shopping town Bus station and within the bounds of the Doncaster Hill Project.</p>

<p>Doncaster is at the heart of Melbourne’s eastern corridor. The Doncaster Hill Strategy is a $2 billion initiative adopted by the Manningham City Council as a response to increased demand for more appropriate, sustainable and diverse housing options that accommodate the municipality’s changing demographic and social needs. The initiative is rejuvenating the city centre and creating a fresh new future for central Doncaster.</p>

<p>The Doncaster Hill Strategy was adopted in 2002 and provides a 20 year vision to create a mixed use sustainable urban village with medium to high density housing that is within walking distance to shops, restaurants and workplaces.</p>

<p>The site is elongated in a north south direction making it difficult to minimise eastern and western facades. The western facade however is expected to benefit to a degree from shading provided from the adjacent building and additional shading has been introduced to deal with other areas where solar loads would otherwise have been problematic.</p>

<p>Some apartments benefit from dual exposure (openings on opposite sides of the apartment) through doors, windows and in some instances access to naturally ventilated corridor/lobby spaces. This access will assist apartment owners to harness the benefits of cross flow ventilation and cooling when desired.</p>

<p>The project benefits from the provision of recycled water from Yarra Valley Water (YVW) scheme for all apartment toilet flushing.</p>
