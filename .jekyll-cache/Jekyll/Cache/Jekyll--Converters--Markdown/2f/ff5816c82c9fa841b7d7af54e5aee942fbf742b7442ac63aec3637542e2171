I"³<p>The project is to consist of an 11 storey development containing 64 x One Bedroom and 62 x Two Bedroom and 14 x 3 bedroom dwellings (140 dwellings in total). The prominent features of the development are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lift access to be provided to all apartments</li>
  <li>A basement and ground level car park with 191 spaces</li>
  <li>49 bicycle racks in the car parking areas</li>
  <li>Minimum of 3m<sup>3</sup> dedicated storage space for each apartment</li>
  <li>Every apartment has a balcony or yard</li>
  <li>One retail space</li>
  <li>Apartments incorporate shading (in some cases â€˜operableâ€™) and enhanced natural ventilation strategies.</li>
  <li>Dwellings will achieve an average 6.6 Stars energy rating.</li>
  <li>Reverse cycle split systems to each apartment will be specified to be within one star of highest available at time of purchase.</li>
  <li>Energy efficient fluorescent and LED lighting throughout all apartments and common areas.</li>
  <li>Minimum 4-star solar hot water storage with gas boost will supply domestic hot water to each dwelling and the tenancy</li>

  <li>Bicycle parking provided to tenants.</li>
  <li>Retention of heritage listed components of the original faÃ§ade.</li>
  <li>Energy â€“ 40% improvement over conventional practice.</li>
  <li>Greenhouse Gas Emissions â€“ The benchmark emissions for an equivalent conventional development are 7,959 kg/CO2/dwelling. The emissions target is 5,969 kg/CO2/dwelling and this development exceeds this with total emissions of 4,740kg/CO2/dwelling.</li>
  <li>Peak Demand 80.6% improvement over conventional practice.</li>
  <li>Water - 33% reduction in potable water use (25% minimum required by council). This will equate to an annual usage of around 95.6 kL of mains water per dwelling.</li>
  <li>Storm water - 106% STORM treatment will be achieved (100% minimum required by council)</li>
