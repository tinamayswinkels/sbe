I" <p>SBE provides a comprehensive suite of building simulation services designed to assess and optimise building performance. Some of these services include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Thermal and energy modelling</li>
  <li>Daylighting, glare and shading analysis</li>
  <li>Computational Fluid Dynamics</li>
  <li>Natural ventilation optimisation</li>
  <li>HVAC validations</li>
  <li>Resource efficiency opportunities</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on the projectâ€™s requirement, the results obtained from simulations can be used to compare design solutions, validate design choices, predict performance outcomes, and report performance outcomes to relevant authorities and bodies.</p>
