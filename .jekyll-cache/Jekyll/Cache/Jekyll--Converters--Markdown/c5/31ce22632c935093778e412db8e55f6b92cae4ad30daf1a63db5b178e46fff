I"s<p>Our first project at 367 KEILOR RD is a mixed-use development with 21 dwellings and 2 commercial units.  We completed NatHERS ratings using the FR5 tool which is a mandatory requirement for BESS and calculated the on-site reuse of stormwater under the guidance of Rob.  We also attended a meeting with the developers of a new stormwater tool which was exciting.</p>
