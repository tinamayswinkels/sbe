I";<p>A new suburb is to be proclaimed for Melbourne, featuring medium rise multi-residential buildings and proposed accommodation for 10,000.  Image below taken from <strong><em><a href="http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/new-inner-melbourne-suburb-of-macaulay-to-be-rezoned-making-way-for-thousands-of-homes/news-story/b0245be4aae79baa80dda975f545458c">Herald Sun article</a></em></strong> by Alex White October 22, 2017.</p>

<p>Similar releases of land may take place over the next few years, some of them more remote than others.</p>

<p>Here are our top ten ESD initiatives we’d like to see incorporated into the planning guidelines for a new suburb:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Ensure effective public transport is present and available from day one.</li>
  <li>Plan for supporting activities, retail, office and community support facilities.</li>
  <li>Plan for safe bike and pedestrian movement, with connected paths and green spaces to enable safe movement across and within the development. If there is a new school is should be at the nexus of a web of these paths and green zones and the school should be available for all, day and night.</li>
  <li>Electric bikes and cars should receive encouragement and support (public charging stations).</li>
  <li>Multi storey dwellings should be high performance and comply with the BADS apartment guidelines.  However, greater trade-offs should be considered between well delivered communal spaces (including green roofs) and daylighting in apartments.</li>
  <li>Significant renewable energy generation on site and interlinked systems to help power local public utilities such as waste water treatment, street lighting, the local school etc.</li>
  <li>Planting pallets should by local, indigenous and/or fruit bearing.</li>
  <li>Rainwater capture and reuse, consolidated stormwater treatment and recycling of same for reuse in irrigation.</li>
  <li>Community gardens, markets.</li>
  <li>Share economy motivators, e.g. <strong><em><a href="https://transitionbanyule.org.au/about-transition-towns/">Transition Town Networks</a></em></strong></li>
</ol>
