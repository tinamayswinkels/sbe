I"(<p>With the release of the <a href="https://www.abcb.gov.au/Resources/Publications/NCC-2019-Public-Comment-Draft/NCC-2019-Volume-One" target="_blank">NCC 2019</a> approaching (expected for May 2019) we have taken some time to familiarise ourselves with the proposed changes to Section J. In particular, we focused on the Deemed-to-Satisfy (DTS) Section J1.5 Wall-Glazing Construction which proposes a new approach in which wall and glazing performance is calculated as a system value and different orientations and levels can be assessed together.</p>
