I"Ë<p>SBE was engaged to provide specialist ESD consulting services focused on thermal performance for the development of the new Levantine Hill Winery in Coldstream.</p>

<p>As part of this project, SBE completed computer modelling to help optimise the design, looking for example at the range of temperatures within the underground cellar that could be expected in free-running mode. This consequentially informed the insulation and conditioning strategy.</p>
