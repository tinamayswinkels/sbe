Aquatic, sports and leisure centres are health, recreational, and social facilities that play an important role in the well-being of communities. Incorporating sustainability in this type of facilities is thus not just about increasing their efficiency, but also about creating an environment that fosters a healthy life-style, social interaction, and a sense of place.
