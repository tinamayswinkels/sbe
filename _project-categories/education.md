An increasing understanding of the importance of good indoor environment quality for the learning outcomes, health and well-being of students are supporting the interest in improving the performance of educational facilities. Strategies including daylighting, the specification of sustainable and non-toxic building materials, the introduction of biophilic design principles, and the use of renewable energy sources are all gaining attention in school design.
