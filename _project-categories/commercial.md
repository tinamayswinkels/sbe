Commercial buildings could be considered one of the great icons of the twentieth century. With commercial buildings dominating the skylines of most cities and town centres, they have come to represent one of the most notable indicators of economic activity, as well as social, technological, and financial progress. Through the increasing uptake of sustainability initiatives in the built environment, a new generation of high-performance commercial buildings is beginning to emerge. These offer owners and users increased worker satisfaction and productivity, improved health, greater flexibility, and enhanced energy and environmental performance.
