Health care facilities encompass a wide range of types, from small and relatively simple medical clinics to large, complex, and costly, teaching and research hospitals. Increasing competition for both patients and staff means that healthcare facilities look at their buildings as a way to differentiate from competitors.Â  In this regards, the inclusion of sustainability features not only results in resource efficiency, but also in an improved working and healing environment that often lead to shorter recovery periods, as well as decreased pain management treatments, and secondary disease.
