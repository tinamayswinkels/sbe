From single detached dwellings to apartment buildings and social housing, residential developments aim to provide shelter and comfort to their occupants. With increasing legislation regulating the built environment, in the last decade residential buildings have had to become more efficient. Sustainability in this type of development is about ensuring healthy, safe, comfortable, resource and cost efficient housing for people of all socio-economic backgrounds.
